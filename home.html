<h1><strong>Welcome to the new Blueberry Group Wiki</strong></h1>
<p>The Blueberry Wiki is full of useful information about everything Blueberry related.</p>
<p>This new WikiJS based tool has a significant number of benefits over the old Confluence based system, this first of these is the clean looking, easy to navigate Interface.</p>
<p>In this first release of the new Wiki, we have made use of the default Global Navigation tool but in a future version, we will be introducing our own version of this.</p>
<h1>The Interface</h1>
<p>Depending on your level of access, some of these options may not be available to you.</p>
