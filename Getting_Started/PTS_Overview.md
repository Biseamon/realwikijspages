# Introduction

PTS is the project management system used by Blueberry and can be found here.

It is used throughout the entire organisation to support the business in many ways that include:

Planning and tracking project progress - Blueberry Systems go further by using PTS to support their Agile based project delivery methodology;
Invoice generation using milestones;
Management Reporting;
Resource Planning;
Time sheet recording of employees across the Blueberry group so that Developer Invoices can be produced;
Customer Issue Tracking;
Enquiry Management and follow up
Resource Planning;
Time sheet recording of employees across the Blueberry group so that Developer Invoices can be produced.


For Developers that are working on a project, the Project Managers need to know several things:

What tasks/issues are you currently working on?
What tasks/issues are you planning to do next?
Do you have any questions about the tasks/issues that have been assigned to you?
What are you spending your time on?
How far are you through a task/issue?
What tasks have you recently completed?
Which build will I be able to see fixed issues/completed tasks in?
and PTS provides the reporting needed to support this. It is therefore vitally important that you update PTS as needed by your Project Manager. If PTS is used properly, all of this becomes a very simple task to complete.

One of the most important benefits from PTS is that more than one manager/BB staff member can log in to PTS and see task/issue statuses. This is especially important if the main project manager is unavailable. We do not have to worry if there might be information sitting in emails or skype sessions that we canâ€™t access.
