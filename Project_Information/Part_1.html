<p><br><br><strong>From:</strong> Andrew Oakley<br><strong>Sent:</strong> 22 June 2015 11:05<br><strong>Subject:</strong> Hudson deployment checklist and long-term deployment plan<br><br>As you know we have been having trouble with deployments to live with Hudson, and Alex, Nikolay and especially Hudson have been finding this frustrating. This is a separate issue to coding bugs. It’s perfectly understandable that a human being will make mistakes, so I am making a plan to reduce these mistakes (and reduce the frustration!).<br><br>The plan is:<br>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>Make a list of manual deployment steps – Nikolay</li>
  <li>Review the list, make corrections, add in missing parts - Alex</li>
  <li>Use the list to manually put the system live – Nikolay</li>
  <li>For any bugs found after go-live, keep updating the list – Nikolay and Alex</li>
</ol>
<p><br>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>Write automated scripts to perform as many parts of the list as possible (Jenkins? PowerShell?) – Nikolay</li>
  <li>Review the scripts, makes corrections, add in missing parts – Alex</li>
  <li>Use the scripts to automatically or semi-automatically put the system live</li>
  <li>Keep updating the scripts – Nikolay and Alex</li>
  <li>Eventually… fully automatic deployment! ;-)</li>
</ol>
<p><br>&nbsp;<br><br>I estimate stages 1-3 should take about 2-5 days – Nikolay, Alex, are you okay with doing this work this &amp; next week?<br><br>We then gradually move towards steps 5-8 over the next 1-3 months.<br><br>We arrive at step 9 – fully automated deployment - in 3-6 months. Nikolay, Alex, does that sound reasonable?<br><br>I suggest Nikolay writes this list on the BB Wiki so that we can all review and edit.</p>

<h2>AutoDeploy&nbsp;</h2>
<p>A Windows application connected to PTS and Amazon S3 and can automatically install a new website version on a server. Once it detects a new web site version committed to PTS (and added to Amazon), the service receives a notification that a new version was released, downloads it from Amazon and installs/updates the current machine. If necessary, it also updates the database.</p>

        <td colspan="1">Developed by Victor Simart.&nbsp;<br>This project started a simple request of some people in the office asking for a way to be warned when a customer email has not been answered within 15 minutes. Then, if a project manager notices one, it would mean support team is struggling and some of them may help us saying “I’m on this one”.&nbsp;<br>A few time after, Victor has been asked to create another plugin to help us with PTS which website’s a bit slow, so he added a simple interface to create these emails easily, based on customer emails.&nbsp;<br>Victor also has another feature to add, but he's not on it yet at all. He plans to try to do it as soon as possible.&nbsp;<br>Victor needed some webservice for the PTS feature as it needs to get the list of projects from the PTS. Talking with Oliver G., Martin G., Alex V. […] they wanted him to merge all of his features within their existing add-in. The thing is that they are using a huge library and merging both would make it all even bigger and slower and people here just &nbsp;wanted one simple feature.&nbsp;<br>So, Victor is developing his own version at the moment and will try to merge his features with their at the very end.</td>

<h1>Watchdog&nbsp;</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>A Watchdog - What is that?&nbsp;</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is a simple feature that checks that certain emails are answered within a preset delay. If not, a notification (As a MessageBox) pops and warns you about any unanswered email.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493648/85493650.png"></figure>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Here's a screenshot of a popup generated by Blueberry Outloot.</i><br><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493648/85493649.png"></figure>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><br><i>If you click "Open" it opens the email so you can review and reply to it quickly if necessary.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><br><strong>Here are a few things that you have to know :</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>As it is an add-in, it may slightly&nbsp;slow down Outlook's startup.</li>
  <li>On startup, the add-in watches for all the unanswered mail within the max delay you specified in the settings.<br>So if you have just started your working day, you instantly know if anything requires your attention.</li>
  <li>The add-in creates a new tab to Outlook's homepage called "BLUEBERRY" which contains a group named "Watchdog" : there is one toggle button that enables/disables the add-in and one button to change its settings.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><br><strong>How it works :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The add-in looks through all the emails received within the delay you specified.<br>In these last emails, it checks that they are not blacklisted (Or that they are white-listed depending on your settings). Once done, it checks that the&nbsp;<i>To</i>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<i>CC</i>&nbsp;field contains at least one string specified in your settings.<br>If all those steps are validated then a timer starts and if it comes to the end, the MessageBox pops.<br>All along these steps, the add-in checks if the watched emails have been answered. As in Blueberry we always&nbsp;<i>reply to all</i>, the address that was contacted will also receive the answer and so the timer of the email will be stopped as soon as the add-in has detected the answer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">NB: You understand that an email is considered answered when any email that you receive is more recent and the former sender is now in To or CC field.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There is no check about the purpose of the email.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><br><strong>How to manage the Settings :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you want to know more about the Settings, please see below</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>Settings Screen&nbsp;</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is what the Watchdog's Settings screen looks like :</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493651/85493657.png"></figure>
<p><br><i>Blueberry Outloot - Watchdog Settings Screen</i></p>
<p>First, as the plugin has originally been released for the support team, you can see options like "<i>Support Hours</i>" and "<i>Support Days</i>". Do not worry, you can freely use this functionality without doing any support, here are all the explanations you may need about the different settings.</p>
<p>The Settings screen can be decomposed in 4 parts. I will do so to explain you each single setting of it.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1) Popup Delays :</strong></p>
<p>The Popup delay part contains two numeric fields :</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493651/85493652.png"></figure>
<p><br><i>&nbsp; Settings Screen - Popup Delay Fields</i></p>
<p><strong>Popup delay</strong> represents the delay you allow to any email to be unanswered.<br>Given this previous screenshot, the emails have up to 15 minutes to be answered. If no answer is received within this delay, a popup will appear to remind you to answer the email.</p>
<p><strong>Popup max delay</strong> stands for the maximum delay within which you want to be warned about any unanswered email.<br>Basically, this setting should be useful only once a day since you are notified after 15 minutes. But in the case you just arrived at work, you may want to know what emails are critical within a larger amount of time.<br>Given this previous screenshot, arriving at work at <strong>8:30</strong>&nbsp;and starting Outlook will let me know if an email has not been answered since <strong>8 o'clock</strong>.</p>
<p><u>NB</u>: If you disable then re-enable the watchdog, you'll be notified of all the emails unanswered within the last 30 minutes with this settings.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It is the same if you close re-open Outlook.</p>
<p><br><strong>2) Support Time :</strong></p>
<p>The Support Time is made of the Support Hours and the Support Days :</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493651/85493655.png"></figure>
<p><br><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Settings Screen - Support Hours &amp; Days</i></p>
<p><strong>Support Hours</strong> contains two masked fields :</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Start</strong> which corresponds to the starting watching time.</li>
  <li><strong>Stop</strong>&nbsp;which corresponds to the end watching time.</li>
</ul>
<p>For instance, if I start Outlook at <strong>6 o'clock</strong>&nbsp;and a mail is unanswered, I will not be notified of it. The watchdog will wake up after <strong>8 o'clock</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Support Days</strong> contains 7 check-boxes corresponding to the 7 days of the week.<br>Again, if there are unanswered emails in days that are not ticked, you won't receive any notification.</p>
<p>These previous settings mean the watchdog will warn for any unanswered email between 8 am and 5:30 pm on working days only.</p>
<p><br><strong>3) Filter List :</strong></p>
<p>The Filter List is composed of many controls :</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493651/85493654.png"></figure>
<p><br><i>Settings Screen - Filter List</i></p>
<p>You can notice a <strong>check-box</strong> next to "Enable" that let you enable/disable this setting whether you want (or not) to set a blacklist/white-list.<br>You then have a <strong>combo-box</strong>&nbsp; that let you choose between a blacklist and a white-list. It is up to you if you prefer to be warned on a few email addresses or on any address except a few.<br>A <strong>text-box</strong> that let you type anything to add to the list. You then have to press the&nbsp;<strong>+</strong>&nbsp;<strong>button</strong> to add it to the list (If not already in).<br>The&nbsp;<strong>- button</strong>&nbsp;removes the selected items of the list. You can select many and delete them all at once.<br>A <strong>list-box</strong>&nbsp;containing all the strings that you want to filter.</p>
<p><u>NB:</u>&nbsp;This list is case-insensitive, no need to add noreply, NoReply, nORepLY [...]<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Furthermore, it does not work on a full word match principle. Which means you can add "noreply" to stand for every single email address that would contain "noreply" (noreply@bbconsult.co.uk, noreply@google.com, noreply@confluence.bbconsult.co.uk, etc...).</p>
<p><br><strong>4) Strings to look for :</strong></p>
<p>This list is almost like the previous one :</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493651/85493653.png"></figure>
<p><br><i>Settings Screen - Strings to look for</i></p>
<p>The content of the <strong>list-box</strong>&nbsp;is the strings that should appear in the <strong>TO or CC fields</strong> of your received emails. As soon as one single item of this list is found in one of these fields, the email is watchable, otherwise it is filtered.<br>As the add-in was originally designed for the support team, this list contains "support". It means that any email sent to any support email list (coloplast-support@blueberrysystems.co.uk, vtg-support@blueberrysystems.co.uk, blueberry-support@bbconsult.co.uk, etc...) is a valid one.<br>Here, if an email is sent to every single person of the support team without the support mailing list in <i>To</i> or <i>CC</i> field, the add-in will not warn about the email if it turns to be unanswered.</p>
<p><u>Warning :</u></p>
<p>This filtering is based on the <strong>display names</strong> in <i>To</i> or <i>CC</i> fields. It means that if you specify something like "martin.green@bbconsult.co.uk", the add-in may not work if the Sender has the email address in its contact with a full name like "Martin Green".<br>Considering this, I would advise you to put just "martin" in the list in this example.</p>
<p><u>NB:</u>&nbsp;This list is also case-insensitive, no need to specify all the possibilities like Martin, martin, mArTIn&nbsp;[...]<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It is not working on a full word match principle either. Which means that "support" will stand for any entry containing "support" (coloplast-support@blueberrysystems.co.uk, Coloplast Support, insupportable@gmail.com, etc...).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Saving the Settings :</strong></p>
<p>Once you have entered your desired settings, you can either click the "Cancel" button to quit without saving anything or click "OK" to save it all.<br>A verification of the different impossible cases is made before saving, for example, your max popup delay can not be less or equal to the popup delay.<br>The Settings Screen let you type any&nbsp;nonsense&nbsp;thing but will catch you up before saving.</p>
<p>There you can either read the error message and correct your mistake(s) or just click "Cancel" to leave without saving.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the settings saved (After clicking "Ok") the watchdog cleans every former watched emails and immediately restarts one (if Enabled). Therefore you may directly have some popups after saving and do not forget the first scan will be based on the max delay in this case.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Outloot Installation Steps&nbsp;</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">First, download the installer by clicking the following link : &lt;NoLinkYet&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Your folder should contain this :</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493658/85493661.png"></figure>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><br><i>Blueberry Outloot installation</i> folder.<br><br>Please, be sure to close Outlook before installing the add-in. You can uninstall any precedent version if you want (Control Panel &gt; Programs and Features &gt; BlueberryOutloot) but new versions should erase any former one.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Launch the setup by double-clicking on it.<br>The installer may need an internet access to validate the certificate so you may be issuing problems if you are not connected to the Internet.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493658/85493660.png"></figure>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><br><i>This is the normal certificate validation message that you should have.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just click the&nbsp;<i>Install</i> button to install the add-in.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The add-in should be running as soon as you will start Outlook. You can check by looking for the new tab called "BLUEBERRY" on Outlook's homepage.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493658/85493659.png"></figure>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>The new tab created by the add-in.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><br>NB: If you think the add-in may not be running, here is how to check its current state :<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Go to File &gt; Options &gt; Customize Ribbon and tick "Developer" in the right list.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Click the new tab "DEVELOPER" that appeared on your homepage.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Click "COM Add-Ins"<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Check that "BlueberryOutloot" is ticked in the list.</p>
<h1>Contact Sync&nbsp;</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The application helps organizing contacts between several Google accounts: remove dupes, group, edit contacts etc.</p>

<h1>GDManager&nbsp;</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The google drive manager is the core object which contains all of the file and folder information.</p>
<h2>Instruction:</h2>
<p>Once the environment is set up call the connect function in function.py which will return the service (the client_secret.json need to be in the same folder as function.py).</p>
<p>Then create a new GDManager by passing the service object and the email of the owner of the drive.</p>
<p>On creation, the GDManager will get all files and folder information from google drive and then start drawing their paths.</p>
<p>Once GDManager has finish initialising you can call its sort method to have it sort all the files and folder in different dictionaries.</p>
<p>The Dictionaries are written as so: {“file/folder ID”: file/folder Object}</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Google Sync Checker&nbsp;</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The application checks if files on the local Google drive folder were correctly synchronised with their cloud copies by Google docs sync.</p>

<h1>Python script which cleans-up directories&nbsp;</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>by Nethmin S, 19 Jul 2018&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I came here for work experience Martin gave some tasks to complete during the time I was here, one of which was to write a python script which cleans-up directories.</p>
<p>I finished it half-way through my second week here. This is the script, imporvements are always welcome.</p>
<p>The script can delete files based on size, extension, rename files with the same double extension, and delete files based on their last accessed date or last date of modification.</p>
<p>Currently it also has an automatic mode where it deletes files based on preset values, which it tells the user before-hand.</p>
<p>(I'm currently writing this in the midst of testing the script)</p>
<p>edit: The indents havn't gotten copied over to the article but they should be on this computer in the VS Code file which contains the original code.</p>
<p>Credit to Asghar for helping me with this, ("He wrote the double extension fixing bit, which is why its really looks more complex")</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>#This is a python script written in order to clean up directories by deleting files with specific extensions, 0 KB files, renaming files with the same double extension<br>#It also deletes files which are three years or older (this is done by looking at the last time of moification and last time of access).</p>
<p><br><br><br>from os import path<br>import click<br>import datetime<br>import os<br>import sys<br>CleanUp = input("Would you like to run an automatic clean up?, This deletes 0 KB files, renames files with the same double extension to only have one extension, deletes files with a modification date or last access date of over 3 years and deletes files with the *.tmp extensino, a for automatic, c for custom, or n for nothing to be done")<br><br>if CleanUp == "a":<br>d = path("C:\\Users\\Lewis\\Documents\\Nethmin_Seneviratne\\ProjectsWork\\Projects\\Test_Folder")<br>filess = d.walkfiles("*.tmp")&nbsp;<br><br>def delfiles():&nbsp;<br>for file in filess:&nbsp;<br>file.remove()<br><br>def DelBySize():<br>d = path("C:\\Users\\Lewis\\Documents\\Nethmin_Seneviratne\\ProjectsWork\\Projects\\Test_Folder") # &lt;-- Enter Directory name here&nbsp;<br>del_size = 0&nbsp;<br>for i in d.walk():<br>if i.isfile() and i.size == del_size:<br>i.remove()<br>delBySize()<br>print("successfully deleted all 0 KB files")<br>delfiles()&nbsp;<br>print("Successfully deleted all .tmp files")&nbsp;<br>@click.command()<br>@click.option(<br>"--directory", "-d", "directory_name", required=True, type=click.Path(exists=True), help="Directory to scan"<br>)<br>def main(directory_name) -&gt; None:<br>"""Entry point."""<br>directory_name = Path("C:\\Users\\Lewis\\Documents\\Nethmin_Seneviratne\\ProjectsWork\\Projects\\Test_Folder").resolve()<br>print(f"Path specified: {directory_name}")<br>for i in directory_name.iterdir():<br>if i.suffixes and len(i.suffixes) &gt; 1 and all(i.suffixes):<br>click.secho(f"{i}: {i.suffixes}", fg="red")<br>new_name = f"{<a href="http://i.name">i.name</a>.rstrip(i.suffix)}{i.suffix}"<br>target = Path(directory_name / new_name)<br>i.rename(target)<br>click.secho(f"Renamed: {<a href="http://i.name">i.name</a>} -&gt; {new_name}", fg="green")<br>if __name__ == "__main__" :<br>main("C:\\Users\\Lewis\\Documents\\Nethmin_Seneviratne\\ProjectsWork\\Projects\\Test_Folder")<br>print("files with souble extensions were successfully renamed")<br>DAYS = 1095<br>time_in_secs = time.time() - (DAYS * 24 * 60 * 60)<br>DelByTime()<br><br>def DelByTime ():<br>for i in d.walk():<br>if i.isfile():<br>if i.mtime &lt;= time_in_secs:<br>i.remove()<br>DAYS = 1095<br>time_in_secs = time.time() - (DAYS * 24 * 60 * 60)<br>DelByTime2()<br><br>def DelByTime2 ():<br>for i in d.walk():<br>if i.isfile():<br>if i.atime &lt;= time_in_secs:<br>i.remove()<br>elif CleanUp == "c":<br>print("Custom mode enabled")<br>elif Cleanup == "n":<br>sys.exit()<br>else:<br>print("Invalid Input")<br>#Creates a path for the directory we're using<br>d = path("C:\\Users\\Lewis\\Documents\\Nethmin_Seneviratne\\ProjectsWork\\Projects\\Test_Folder")<br>#Asks the usr whether they want to delete a files with a specific extension,<br>#If the user says yes, then the program asks for the extension&nbsp;<br>delfile = input("Do you want to delete files with a specific extension?, reply with y or n")<br>if delfile == "y":<br>ext = input("Which files do you want to delete by extension?, *.")<br>delfiles()&nbsp;<br><br>files = d.walkfiles("*.",ext)<br>def delfiles():<br>for file in files:<br>print (file)<br>dele = input("Do you want to delete these files, reply with y or n ")<br>if dele == "y":<br>file.remove()<br>elif dele == "n":<br>print ("Removed {} file".format(file))<br>else:<br>print("invalid input or no file found")<br>#prints the files with the desired extension, then asks if the user wants them deleted<br>#if the user wants them to be deleted they are deketed, if not nothing happens<br><br>def DelBySize():<br>d = path() # &lt;-- Enter Directory name here<br>del_size = 0<br>for i in d.walk():<br>if i.isfile() and i.size == del_size:<br>print (i)<br>deleteZero = input("Do you want to delete these files?, y or n")<br>if deleteZero == "y" and i.size == del_size:<br>i.remove()<br>elif deleteZero == "n":<br>print("Lets move on then")<br>else:<br>print("Invalid Input")<br># This functions walks through all the files in the directory, and looks for 0 KB files<br># The function then prints these files and asks the user weather he wants them deleted.<br># If the user input is yes, then they are deleted, if not then the program moves on to the next part of the clean-up process<br>sizeDel = input("Do you want to delete 0 KB files?

<h1>Screenshot System&nbsp;</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The tool allows a user to capture screenshots and create an interactive demo (a number of HTML files containing the images) as well as to export it to wiki. Shift+PrtScr is used to take screenshots. You can then change the order of the captured screens and add buttons to move to other screenshots. To be able to export to Wiki, you need to change settings in the settings.json file from the application directory,</p>

<h2>Task:</h2>
<p>Make a reminder to keep a leg elevated using a sensor tag as well as a Raspberry PI.</p>
<h2>Location:</h2>
<p><a href="https://svn.bbconsult.co.uk/repository/amp_sensor/trunk">https://svn.bbconsult.co.uk/repository/amp_sensor/trunk</a></p>
<h2>Requirement:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Material: Sensor Tag and Raspberry PI</li>
  <li>Raspberry Pi needs mgp123 installed.</li>
  <li>Package: requirement file can be found it SVN</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instruction:</h2>
<p>Run “is_foot_up.py” and passing in the args: The Sensor tag mac address, number of iteration to calibrate and margin at which the foot is considered to be down.</p>
<h2>Result:</h2>
<p>Result can be seen on this video: <a href="https://flashbackconnect.com/Movie.aspx?id=c7lrdLPrZAa5yGMeVAeELw2">https://flashbackconnect.com/Movie.aspx?id=c7lrdLPrZAa5yGMeVAeELw2</a></p>
<h2>Problem encounter:</h2>
<p>The gyro values were ignored because even while not moving it reported some movement. And a calibration could not be properly made because this “noise” varies too much to be taken into account and subtracted from the final result.</p>

<h2>Holiday Request</h2>
<p>We have a suggestion to create a Holiday Request Form in PTS&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>User enters preferred holiday period</li>
  <li>System then puts holiday onto approval screen for PM</li>
  <li>When holiday is approved, we use Exchange API to add to shared calendar for the employee’s company</li>
</ol>
<p>To think about</p>
<ol>
  <li>We have timesheet approvals.&nbsp; I think this should be generalized to “approvals”</li>
  <li>HR should explain holiday approval rules to Oliver</li>
  <li>Shared calendar update may only be for UK people.&nbsp; I think BB Systems has separate calendar to Consult?</li>

<h2>Expenses / allowance approval</h2>
<p>PTS requires a PM to approve hours but it does not currently require a PM to approve expenses or allowances. We’d like a change to PTS so that everything that appears on an invoice also appears in PTS as an item to approve on the approval page.</p>

<p>he reason is to avoid sending new user passwords within BB email – it’s a security improvement. I’m sure the registration form would be extended to capture other data…</p>

<h1>Developer Tasks - Mini Project Features&nbsp;</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Mini Project Concept</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sysadmins don’t use PTS, nor does Marketing. &nbsp;They find it too clunky and complex. &nbsp;A lot of this is because PTS is slow - if we fix issue editor screens, we can improve this.</p>
<p>But Sysadmins and Marketing have other issues – they have lots of mini projects, for&nbsp;example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Migrate Exchange to 365</li>
  <li>Fix LDAP Security</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem is that creating each one of these as a PTS project requires loads of&nbsp;fields that&nbsp; aren't required. &nbsp;And these mini projects are too small to really get their&nbsp;own project ID.</p>
<p>Really we&nbsp;need a concept of a mini project.<br><br>My thinking is that we should make it so that individual tasks can be Mini Projects – we promote a task to be a mini project, and then maybe some extra fields appear.</p>
<p>We can then add extra screens to PTS to show all the mini projects by some criteria.</p>
<p>Question: &nbsp;can we have mini projects at any point in the tree? &nbsp; I don’t know. &nbsp;If we allow Mini Projects to exist at lower tree levels, then we can use the hierarchy to organise them - so we can have a collection of security tasks. &nbsp;But this does make it a lot more complex.</p>
<p>I'd probably say that mini projects can't contain other mini projects, and any folders above a mini project must be just a container. &nbsp;But it needs more thought</p>
<p>Mini Projects would exist within a normal PTS project, so we might have a PTS project for Sysadmin, one for PTS, and one for BBWT - each including a list of significant mini projects.</p>
<h2>Project Groups</h2>
<hr>
<p>Are mini projects another way of doing project groups? &nbsp; At present, a PTS project is completely standalone. &nbsp;This quite often gives us a problem: &nbsp;if we get two related projects from customer - which share code and timescales - it feels wrong to put them into two different projects. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe Mini Projects could fix this - we could have a project called BIMS with mini or subprojects of EOBS and Core?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What do we do with Mini Projects</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main thing that mini projects allows is for us to make a list of all current mini projects, perhaps with an owner, and some idea of time left or completion date</p>
<figure class="table">
  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <th>Mini Project</th>
        <th>In Project</th>
        <th>Owner</th>
        <th>Target Completion Date</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Exchange Migration</th>
        <th>Systems</th>
        <th>Asghar</th>
        <th>1st October 2016</th>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</figure>
<p>I suppose Mini Projects would also gain other features of big projects, but I'm not sure exactly which yet&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.png" alt="(smile)"></figure>
<p>One idea is to publish mini project details to the wiki?</p>
<h2>Dependencies / Multiple Parents</h2>
<hr>
<p>PTS at present has a strict hierarchy which is currently used to model the functional breakdown of tasks and dependency. &nbsp;This is a bit limited compared to other tools<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This becomes more important when using PTS for syadmin tasks, because it's more likely there will be common dependencies between mini projects. &nbsp;If two projects are dependent on one common task, we can't represent this in PTS properly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The big question is how exactly to present this in the UI? &nbsp;UIs to represent tree structures that support multiple parents are very hard to do well - users struggle to know how to delete one parent, for example.</p>
<p>Options:<br>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>We have a simple system: &nbsp;a mini project can be linked to multiple tasks elsewhere in the containing project as dependent tasks, but this isn't in the tree as such<br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>We allow a task from another mini project to be dragged into the tree and it appears with a shortcut icon. &nbsp;Note that marking the imported task in this way means that each task actually has one real parent and inbound links from other places. &nbsp;This may simplify the logic a bit.<br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Maybe we only allow mini projects to be dependent on other mini projects. &nbsp;This feels too limited.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>New Issues / Tasks / Tickets Management Pages&nbsp;</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>I think we need to do a big overhaul of tasks/issues management inside PTS - it is far too slow, and is&nbsp; wasting a lot of people's time.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>I think we should have merged issue+tickets+tasks page, so a PM can look through all items that need action on a project.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Users should be able to see a list of issues/tasks in an LHS panel, and then open the details in a right side panel - this should be much faster than switching to a new screen. &nbsp;Obviously it can be difficult to get everything on one screen, but wide-screens are common.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>We are potentialy standardising on Office 365, and maybe we could integrate with it more directly - this might make it easier to discuss PTS issues in outlook?</li>
</ol>
<h2>Previous Designs and Implementation</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have this google doc:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KoKEDLR3P6TGMSHyIdsV69MlWnkbu88FylY6haNcyU4/edit#heading=h.m1ppfmqbyw70">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KoKEDLR3P6TGMSHyIdsV69MlWnkbu88FylY6haNcyU4/edit#heading=h.m1ppfmqbyw70</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And the associated XLS:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="https://drive.google.com/a/bbconsult.co.uk/file/d/0BwrpSzy5Mr1HMEJaLU1DNG9WR28/view?ths=true">https://drive.google.com/a/bbconsult.co.uk/file/d/0BwrpSzy5Mr1HMEJaLU1DNG9WR28/view?ths=true</a>&nbsp;<br><br>We have new issues page here -&nbsp;<a href="http://ptsa.bbconsult.co.uk/#/issues">http://ptsa.bbconsult.co.uk/#/issues</a></p>
<h2>Review / Edit Issues without Opening New Window</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think the best idea is to have a dual mode screen. &nbsp;I open up the issues/tasks/tickets search screen, and I&nbsp; can perform filtered searches and see a big grid. &nbsp;I can use a tooltip to view more details. &nbsp; If I click the issue<br>title, the grid shrinks to only a few columns, and an editor panel appears on the right. &nbsp;I can now click on issues and they appear in the right hand side panel.</p>
<p>Another option: &nbsp;we display the detail window in a separate screen. &nbsp;Some BB people spend a lot of time reviewing issues, and they could have one smaller screen to show the issue list, another larger screen<br>to show the detail. &nbsp; To support this we'd need to have a special mode which can be enabled and saved to that PCs' cookies.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Review Issues / Tasks / Tickets in One Screen</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think it's useful to have a single screen where I can see all issues and tasks for a project, and&nbsp; review / close them. &nbsp;The "issue editor" panel would change depending on which item is selected.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what issues this presents? &nbsp; I guess for issues / tasks do not have identical status values which may make filtering more complex?</p>
<h2>Implementation Approach</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suggest</p>
<ul>
  <li>We review and improve the new Angular issues screen, taking time to get it right - and thinking of it as a template for other screens to come<br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>We implement the dual mode with a dummy issue review panel, and see how this feels<br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>We then work on the full issue panel, so we can put this into general use<br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>The we do tasks screen and tasks panel<br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Then we create a merged tasks / issues screen</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>PTS as Todo List Manager&nbsp;</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>We've tried many todo list management tools previously - like todo ist and toodledo</p>
<p>I'd like to use PTS as the todo list for BB people.</p>
<h2><strong>Implementation</strong></h2>
<p>I think we need a mobile-compatble web view which shows all the tasks I'm responsible for.</p>
<p>It will take a bit more design&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>BVI&nbsp;</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Amazon Web Services: Deploying a new live version of AWS BVI&nbsp;</h2>
<h3>Checking Lambda:</h3>
<p>Before deploying a new live version, the lambdas need the following checks:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Cognito_BVI_Post_Authentication_Python<ul>
      <li>Check if every SQL query are functional.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Cognito_BVI_Pre_Sign_up_Python<ul>
      <li>Check if every SQL query are functional.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Note: <strong>Grabcut</strong> and <strong>BVI engine</strong> are also using SQL so they need a check as well.</p>
<h3>Test Run:</h3>
<p>Once all lambdas have been checked and change to use the next live values. A full test is required and any critical fail need fixing.</p>
<p>For this it is best to double check that all API Gateway end points are using the correct Lambda on the beta stage.</p>
<h3>Deploying a new live version:</h3>
<p>Once the future version has passed the test program, create a new version of the lambdas and stage using the instruction at the following link: <a href="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/display/BLUEB/Amazon+Web+Services%3A+Deploying+a+stable+stage+of+an+API+gateway+calling+Lambda">https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/display/BLUEB/Amazon+Web+Services%3A+Deploying+a+stable+stage+of+an+API+gateway+calling+Lambda</a></p>
<p>The new stage should be named “app_test_” followed by the release date. Ex: ‘app_test_17_02_17’.</p>
<p>Once the API deployed reverse all method to use the latest lambda to avoid having to do so when deploying the next time to beta.</p>
<p>Then make a copy of the swagger file and rename it to contain the new stage name.</p>
<p>The next step is to update the app_test usage Plan:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Go to Usage Plans</li>
  <li>Select the usage plan you want to add to stage to.</li>
  <li>Under "Associated API Stages" choose the BVI Web Service API for the API and then choose the new created Stage.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Amazon Web Services: Create a new versioned Lambda Function</h3>
<ul>
  <li>First go to the Function console <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home?region=us-east-1#/functions?display=list">https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home?region=us-east-1#/functions?display=list</a> and click on the function name you want to create a new version of.</li>
  <li>On the action menu select Publish new version a pop up will asking to enter a description of the version.</li>
</ul>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493727/85493737.png"></figure>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493727/85493736.png"></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Press the publish button once you added some useful text to the description.</li>
  <li>Once publish you will be sent on the version page of the lambda. Although it says you are now viewing the code of new version it is not the case this is why given a good description of the version is useful to recognize it.<br>Note that the Qualifiers button change to Version: [id]</li>
</ul>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493727/85493735.png"></figure>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493727/85493734.png"></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Switching from one version to another can be done by pressing&nbsp; the “Version : [id]” / “Qualifiers” button and selecting the version id on the versions tab.</li>
</ul>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493727/85493733.png"></figure>
<h3>Amazon Web Services: Call lambda on API Gateway by its version</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Go to the AWS API Gateway console and select your API.</li>
  <li>Under resource select the method you want to change lambda version.</li>
  <li>Go to the Integration Request.</li>
</ul>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493727/85493732.png"></figure>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493727/85493731.png"></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Click on the Pen next to “Lambda Function” and add “:” + the version id to the function name.</li>
  <li>Press the check mark to save the change.</li>
  <li>Repeat process for all method you’d like to use lambda function.</li>
</ul>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493727/85493730.png"></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Then deploy the api to an existing stage or create a new stage using the action button, Deploy API option.</li>
</ul>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493727/85493729.png"></figure>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493727/85493728.png"></figure>
<p>The method will now call the versioned lambda instead of the latest lambda.</p>
<h2>Amazon Web Services: Python lambda&nbsp;</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Python lambda:</h3>
<p>To get started with using AWS Lambda this link will get you through the basic tutorial of making a lambda function: <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/getting-started.html">http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/getting-started.html</a></p>
<h3>Boto3:</h3>
<p>Boto3 is the AWS SDK for Python. Its documentation can be found here: <a href="https://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">https://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/</a></p>
<p>To use Boto3 on AWS lambda you just need to import the module in the code as amazon already has it installed. You will also need to give your lambda a role which allow access to the resources your function will be using.</p>
<p>To use Boto3 on a computer you will need to install boto3 on your python environment and save a IAM key in a config file in your user folder as explained here:</p>
<p><a href="https://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/quickstart.html#configuration">https://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/quickstart.html#configuration</a></p>
<p>For example, the location where you will save the key in windows would be: C:\Users\User-Name\.aws</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To learn how to access AWS resources Boto3 has a good documentation here: <a href="https://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/services/index.html">https://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/services/index.html</a></p>
<p>There are two way to access to Aws resources:</p>
<ul>
  <li>By using the client: client = boto3.client('sqs')</li>
  <li>By using the resource: sqs = boto3.resource('sqs')</li>
</ul>
<p>The main difference is if you need to create new resources like a new SQS queues you will need to use the client and if you just need to access existing resources using ‘resource’ is better although you can also do it using the client.</p>
<h3>Import Package AWS don’t have by default:</h3>
<p>To import package that AWS doesn’t have you will need to create a zip file with the package in it and your python code. Then upload your code to AWS using the upload from a zip file option and in the configuration of your lambda change the Handler to: ‘file_name.method’ where file name is the name of your python file and method is the name of your event handler method.</p>
<p>To know what exactly needs to be added to the zip file read here: <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-python-how-to-create-deployment-package.html">http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-python-how-to-create-deployment-package.html</a></p>
<p><strong>Also, please note that AWS run with Linux so some package installed on windows might be missing stuff to run on Linux environment like it’s the case with ‘pymssql’ so it’s best to add package installed from a Linux environment.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Cognito&nbsp;</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>How it’s set up:</h3>
<h4>Attributes</h4>
<p>Once a Cognito user poll has been created you cannot change the required attributes from the list of proposed attributes. Nor can you delete a custom attribute once created.</p>
<p>To make a custom attribute required you will need to create a lambda that gets triggered at post register (see Triggers below).</p>
<p>The only attributes used are Email and custom:API_Key all other attributes are legacies from an old plan/setup.</p>
<h4>Standard Attributes:</h4>
<p>Email -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Required - Alias</p>

<p>No particular extra permission are needed for the lambda that will get call by Cognito.</p>

<h2>Cognito for .Net:&nbsp;</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using Cognito in .Net is a bit tricky as it doesn’t have all the call tidied up like the other SDKs do to Authenticate, register, validate…</p>
<p>Instead you need to handle all of the crypto and making the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Remote_Password_protocol">SRP</a> protocol work. Thankfully a feature request has been opened and some people shared their solution here: <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-net/issues/495">https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-net/issues/495</a></p>
<p>Those solutions are mostly based on the JS SDK: <a href="https://github.com/aws/amazon-cognito-identity-js/tree/master/src">https://github.com/aws/amazon-cognito-identity-js/tree/master/src</a></p>
<p>In the end this is what has been used in the BVI Test app: <a href="https://gist.github.com/BBNicolas/5ab3f1f8c604ebe2e4ecf14c35487495">https://gist.github.com/BBNicolas/5ab3f1f8c604ebe2e4ecf14c35487495</a></p>
<p>What has been done:</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Register</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Validation</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Login</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Forgot password</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Refresh</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Logout</p>
<p>Part of the device remembering is working (signing in with a new device and remembering it). But when login in a second time using the device key it fails at the Device Authentication.</p>

<h2>Cognito Verify Token&nbsp;</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using a token with AWS API Gateway is really easy, you can find a step by step instruction in AWS documentation here: <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-integrate-with-cognito.html">http://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-integrate-with-cognito.html</a></p>
<p>Create a new API or select an existing API in API Gateway.</p>
<p>From the main navigation pane, choose <strong>Authorizers</strong> under the specified API.</p>
<p>Under <strong>Authorizers</strong>, choose <strong>Create</strong> and then choose <strong>Cognito User Pool Authorizer</strong>.</p>
<p>To configure this authorizer:</p>
<p>Choose a region for <strong>Cognito region</strong>.</p>
<p>For <strong>Cognito User Pool</strong>, choose an available user pool.</p>
<p>The <strong>Authorizer name</strong> field will be automatically populated with the chosen user pool name. However, you can customize it if you want to.</p>
<p>The <strong>Identity token source</strong> field will be set to <code>method.request.header.Authorization</code> by default. However, you can customize it if you want to. Using the default, <code>Authorization</code> will be the name of the incoming request header to contain an API caller's identity token.</p>
<p>Optionally, type a regular expression in the <strong>App client ID regex</strong> field to validate client IDs associated with the user pool.</p>
<p>Choose <strong>Create</strong> to finish integrating the user pool with the API.</p>
<p>Having created the authorizer, you can, optionally, test it by supplying an identity token provisioned from the user pool.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Doing the verification yourself is a bit more work but a aws blog show how to do it:</p>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mobile/integrating-amazon-cognito-user-pools-with-api-gateway/">https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mobile/integrating-amazon-cognito-user-pools-with-api-gateway/</a></p>
<p>A js file can also be found on SVN here:<a href="https://svn.bbconsult.co.uk/repository/bvi/BviAws/Cognito">https://svn.bbconsult.co.uk/repository/bvi/BviAws/Cognito</a></p>
<p>You just need to fill in the user poll id and session token and you can run it with nodejs.</p>

<h3>Basic Description</h3>
<p>Customer has an app that will take two pictures, one from the front, one from the side, create an outline around their profiles, and then send the outlines to the server along with the metrics (height/weight/ethnicity/gender), via a <strong>scan/startsgb</strong> post call.</p>
<p>They get a scan ID returned, and then will send in a JSON packet which contains the results of the survey taken before the images were taken.</p>
<p>The Survey will be linked to the scan via this scan ID.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Examining the data</h3>
<p>The credentials are in Bitwarden, under BVI ShapeGB SQL Express Server. Use SSMS to log in.</p>
<p>The most important tables are <strong>Job</strong>, <strong>SgbSurveyReponses</strong>, and the view <strong>JobMeasurements</strong>.</p>
<h3>dbo.Job</h3>
<p>The following are important columns</p>
<p><strong>Status</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>This shows the status of the scan. If it is a 6, it means that all stages are fine, as there are six stages, and once each stage is passed successfully, it will increment this status.</li>
  <li>-1 means we have detected an issue, normally outside of the system.</li>
  <li>any number lower than 6, means it has failed on the next stage (so a 5 means that there was an error in stage 6, when processing the scan)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Error Text</strong></p>
<p>If the scan failed (specifically if it was -1), the contents of this should give insight into what has gone wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Height/Weight/Age/Gender/Ethnicity</strong></p>
<p>These are all survey information entered by the app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>SgbSurveryResponses</h3>
<p>This table stores the survey responses, taken through the app, in a JSON format. Each survey is linked to to a Job.ID</p>
<p>Example Response:</p>
<figure class="table">
  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <th>{"size_male_trouser":"28L","bonus_enter_prize_draw":false,"about_postcode":"W2","size_male_jacket":"34R","size_male_collar":"15.5 (M)","brands_where_shop":["John Lewis"],"brands_heard_about":"New Look","version":1,"about_ethnicity":"Asian"}</th>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>JobMeasurements</h3>
<p>This is a view created from two tables:</p>
<p>OrdMeasurementsKind which contains the index and measurement area. There are different apps that handle scans, so there isa&nbsp; set of indexes for various measurements per app. For example, the latest app uses ID 297-312 as it's indexes for measurements.</p>
<p>OrdMeasurements which fills in the values attributed to the indexes found in OrdMeasurementsKind, and links it back to the Job.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Accessing the silhouettes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Use the S3Browser, and navigate to bvi-api-uk/SGB/</li>
  <li>In there are the job folders (which correspond to the ID in the Job table), and inside each one are the two silhouettes.</li>
  <li>Highlight the silhouettes, click Download and point them to a file</li>
  <li>They will download (there is no indicator that they have downloaded!)</li>
  <li>Opening these in Notepad++ show a list of co-ordinates, used by the image software to show the outline.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Swagger UI documentation&nbsp;</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BVI's Swagger UI documentation is hosted at&nbsp;<a href="https://bvi-swagger.bbconsult.co.uk">https://bvi-swagger.bbconsult.co.uk</a>. Credentials are available in LastPass.</p>
<p>The documentation is generated at runtime through the use of <a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui">swagger-ui</a>. A Jenkins job checks out the latest version of this, alters the public/index.html to reference the BVI YAML, and then publishes it to&nbsp;<strong>/opt/bvi-swagger/</strong>.</p>
<p>To make modifications to the documentation, check out and modify the YAML from the bvi SVN project in the directory&nbsp;<strong>BviAws/Swagger</strong>.</p>
<p>Use the path bar at the top of the page to access different swagger YAML files if required.</p>
