<p>We use Angular&nbsp;9.1.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://cli.angular.io/">Angular CLI&nbsp;</a>is a powerful and useful tool for building your site.</p>
<h2>TypeScript</h2>
<p>Useful Resources:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html">https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html</a></p>
<h1>Web Server</h1>
<h2>Internet Information Services (IIS)&nbsp;</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Runs under a Windows environment e.g. Microsoft Windows Server.</li>
  <li>Compartmentalisation:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Reduces surface area for attack by turning off unused services and features.</li>
      <li>Lower memory footprint by turning off unused features.</li>
      <li>Ability to build specialised servers specific to the use case; can install 3rd party server components.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Extensibility:<ul>
      <li>With both C++ and ASP.NET support, developers can build solutions and add value to application components (security filtering, load balancing, state management etc.).</li>
      <li>With ASP.NET it allows for application modules and services to be rapidly developed within a familiar interface.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Ability to go from testing environment to deployment; only need to copy configuration files, code, and content from server to server.</li>
</ul>
<h2>NGINX</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Runs under a Linux environment.</li>
  <li>Open source.</li>
  <li>High performance.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Although NGINX can run in a Windows environment, it is not recommended because it is not easy to maintain.</li>
  <li>Because of this we recommend using the following combinations of OS and software:<ul>
      <li>MySQL and NGINX = Linux.</li>
      <li>MS SQL and IIS = Windows.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Kestrel</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Kestrel is built for speed, but consequently has less features than IIS. It is not meant as a replacement for IIS but to compliment it. It is strongly recommended that you run NGINX or IIS as the front-end to Kestrel due to security and management reasons.</p>
<p>Kestrel can be deployed on Linux as well as Windows environments.</p>
<h3>Considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Kestrel by itself is not feature rich. For this and security reasons you should reverse proxy it with either IIS or NGINX.</li>
  <li>Cannot share IP and port with other services.</li>
  <li>Ability to be deployed across Linux and Windows platforms.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Database</h1>
<p>BBWT3 uses LINQ and Entity Framework Core, which supports multiple back-end databases.&nbsp; Our preferred systems are MS SQL and MySQL. (We strongly considered PostgreSQL, which is excellent, but the popularity of MySQL and level of AWS support for MySQL convinced us.&nbsp; But if a customer strongly preferred PostgreSQL, this is possible)</p>
<p>Switching between MySQL and MS SQL Server is not completely free – even though we use Entity Frameworks which hides the underlying DB, we often have to rewrite EF queries, and we usually end up with some native SQL code, which needs to be migrated when switching DB,</p>
<p>On AWS, we now use their Aurora DB because it’s much cheaper than MS SQL and very fast.</p>
<h2>MS SQL</h2>
<h3>Available Editions:</h3>
<p>Express&nbsp;Editions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Free for small scale applications of up to 10GB web apps.</li>
</ul>
<p>Web Edition:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Low cost, provided by hosting services.</li>
  <li>Scaleable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Standard Edition:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Licensing can be done per physical core.</li>
  <li>Licensing can be done by server + CAL (Client Access License); price done by user + device.</li>
  <li>Access to SA (Software Assurance); next version rights, license mobility to shared third party servers, fail-over servers for high availability.</li>
  <li>Maximum of up to 24 cores.</li>
  <li>Maximum memory of 128GB.</li>
</ul>
<p>Enterprise Edition:</p>
<p>Due to the high cost it is never used by Blueberry.</p>
<h3>Considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>MS SQL can be built on top of distributed storage with all the benefits that brings, however it requires extra work to achieve this.</li>
  <li>MySQL can be a cheaper alternative - usually free with only support being paid for.</li>
</ul>
<h2>MySQL and Aurora</h2>
<h3>Advantages of Using MySQL over MS SQL</h3>
<ul>
  <li>More cost effective in the long term - no Microsoft licensing to pay on top of the instance cost.</li>
  <li>Easier to run on a system, lower resource usage than a full desktop shell.</li>
  <li>Better AWS support on the Aurora platform:<ul>
      <li>Distributed storage.</li>
      <li>Data resiliency.</li>
      <li>Master/slave replication and failover.</li>
      <li>Region failover.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>MySQL Available Editions</h2>
<p>Available for free without any support, otherwise:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Standard Edition:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Licensing at $2,000 per annum.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Enterprise Edition:<ul>
      <li>Licensing at $5,000 per annum.</li>
      <li>Integrated with Oracle cloud services.</li>
      <li>Transparent data encryption, key generation and digital signatures.</li>
      <li>Firewall; protection from SQL injection, automatically generates whitelist of SQL statements preventing unauthorised database activity.</li>
      <li>Masking and de-identification; in compliance with GDPR,&nbsp;PCI DSS and HIPPA.</li>
      <li>Backups; support for "hot" backups, full and partial, as well as point in time recovery and compression.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Cluster CGE (Carrier Grade Edition):<ul>
      <li>Licensing at $10,000 per annum.</li>
      <li>Synchronous replication of nodes.</li>
      <li>Automatic fail-over; typically within 1 second.</li>
      <li>Removes single point-of-failure; each node has its own disk and memory.</li>
      <li>Geographical replication; nodes mirrored to remote data centres for disaster recovery.</li>
      <li>Automatic partitioning and scaling; distributed and allows for remote location mirroring to maintain consistency across locations.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Aurora</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Aurora is Amazon's MySQL and PostgreSQL compatible database software that is built for the cloud. It is fully managed by RDS (Amazon Relational Database Service) which means that all backups, software patching and configuration is done by Amazon. It offers a distributed and scalable way to manage your databases.</p>
<h3>Available Editions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Pay as You Go</li>
  <li>On demand pricing; price is calculated on a per hour basis.</li>
  <li>Serverless Pricing<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Measured in ACU's&nbsp;(Aurora Capacity Units). Each ACU has an associated amount of RAM/CPU/networking.</li>
      <li>No instances to pay for; similar to pay as you go, price is calculated on per hour basis.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Reserved Instance Pricing<ul>
      <li>Per database pricing.</li>
      <li>Can pay all up front for larger savings.</li>
      <li>Lower rate per hour.</li>
      <li>Charged per hour even if no usage has occurred.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Advantages of AWS</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Easy migration from existing databases to Amazon's cloud services.</li>
  <li>Distributed storage.</li>
  <li>Data resiliency.</li>
  <li>Master/slave replication and failover.</li>
  <li>Region failover.</li>
  <li>Advanced encryption.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Considerations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Amazon Aurora has useful backup features and is almost always used in a hosting environment with Amazon.</li>
  <li>Project managers may be more familiar with a Windows stack.</li>
  <li>Project managers may have a "if its not broken..." mentality.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Hosting Environments</h1>
<h2>Amazon RDS</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS), is a cloud database hosting service that offers a cheaper, feature-rich solution to database hosting, compared with having your own hardware. Full support of CRUD.</p>
<h3>Advantages</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Supports multiple database formats - PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, as well as MS SQL.</li>
  <li>Storage scales automatically and you only pay for what you consume.</li>
  <li>Flexibility - can automatically increase data plan by 10GB increments up to a total of 64TB.</li>
  <li>Point-in-time backups - can restore database to an earlier point.</li>
  <li>MS SQL license is included in price - either web or standard license.</li>
  <li>An existing MS SQL license can be used.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Disadvantages</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Standard plan offers up to 6TB of storage but does not include automatic resizing capabilities.</li>
  <li>Storage provisioned separately in plans, meaning could be less cost effective than alternative solutions.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Azure SQL DB</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Azure is Microsoft's cloud hosting solution. Microsoft advocates&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/sharding">sharding&nbsp;</a>databases: splitting them into smaller ones so that bottlenecks do not occur with a large and slow database. There is a database maximum file size of up to 1TB, or up to 2.9TB for elastic pools (using pre-defined shared resources). It directly competes with Amazon's RDS offering, and claims that it is up to 5 times cheaper. Has full CRUD support.</p>
<h3>Advantages</h3>
<ul>
  <li>It was designed specifically for the cloud.</li>
  <li>Runs as a service on the Microsoft cloud platform.</li>
  <li>Allows for use of existing Microsoft server or MS SQL license.</li>
  <li>Advocates sharding to improve performance and cost.</li>
  <li>Storage is included in the pricing tier.</li>
  <li>Point in time backups - can restore database to an earlier point.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Disadvantages</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Only supports MS SQL.</li>
  <li>Only allows for database sizes of up to 1TB. However as mentioned this can be mitigated by&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/sharding">sharding</a>.</li>
</ul>
