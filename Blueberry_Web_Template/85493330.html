<h1>Blueberry Group : A9:2017 - Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities&nbsp;</h1>
<p>Created by Jason Cozza on Sep 22, 2020</p>
<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>Components, including libraries and frameworks, may be taken from the open source community and should be used with caution in case vulnerabilities are lurking. As a vulnerable component is exploited, attackers can leverage it and cause the app serious damage and a major loss of data that can undermine the app, and perhaps even the organization.</p>
<p>By using components with known vulnerabilities, attackers can take advantage of that using SQLi and an XSS (among other attack methods) to attempt to takeover and occupy the app.</p>
<h1>Example</h1>
<p>Components typically run with the same privileges as the application itself, so flaws in any component can result in serious impact.</p>
<p>Such flaws can be accidental (e.g. coding error) or intentional (e.g. backdoor in component).</p>
<p>If the web application uses undocumented dependencies this could lead to them not being updated and thus pose a security risk.</p>

<h1>How BBWT3 Mitigates This Vulnerability</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Constant testing with 3rd party tools<br><br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>BBWT3 uses a tool known as Acunetix which scans our code for potential vulnerabilities. When one is identified it is quickly patched so that the integrity of BBWT3 remains.</p>
<p>High risk sites should be tested regularly with both&nbsp;<a href="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/display/BLUEB/How+to+Perform+an+Application+Vulnerability+Scan+with+Acunetix">Acunetix&nbsp;</a>(for application vulnerabilities) and&nbsp;<a href="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/display/BLUEB/How+to+Perform+a+Server+Vulnerability+Scan+with+OpenVAS">OpenVAS&nbsp;</a>(for system vulnerabilities). Note well: Hosts such as Amazon require notification up-front of vulnerability scans. Otherwise, they're unable to differentiate between real and simulated attacks.</p>
