                    <h1 id="A9:2017-UsingComponentswithKnownVulnerabilities-Overview">Overview</h1><p>Components, including libraries and frameworks, may be taken from the open source community and should be used with caution in case vulnerabilities are lurking. As a vulnerable component is exploited, attackers can leverage it and cause the app serious damage and a major loss of data that can undermine the app, and perhaps even the organization.</p><p>By using components with known vulnerabilities, attackers can take advantage of that using SQLi and an XSS (among other attack methods) to attempt to takeover and occupy the app.</p><h1 id="A9:2017-UsingComponentswithKnownVulnerabilities-Example">Example</h1><p>Components typically run with the same privileges as the application itself, so flaws in any component can result in serious impact.</p><p>Such flaws can be accidental (e.g. coding error) or intentional (e.g. backdoor in component).</p><p>If the web application uses undocumented dependencies this could lead to them not being updated and thus pose a security risk.</p><p><br/></p><h1 id="A9:2017-UsingComponentswithKnownVulnerabilities-HowBBWT3MitigatesThisVulnerability">How BBWT3 Mitigates This Vulnerability</h1><ul><li>Constant testing with 3rd party tools<br/><br/></li></ul><p>BBWT3 uses a tool known as Acunetix which scans our code for potential vulnerabilities. When one is identified it is quickly patched so that the integrity of BBWT3 remains.</p><p>High risk sites should be tested regularly with both <a href="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/display/BLUEB/How+to+Perform+an+Application+Vulnerability+Scan+with+Acunetix" rel="nofollow">Acunetix </a>(for application vulnerabilities) and <a href="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/display/BLUEB/How+to+Perform+a+Server+Vulnerability+Scan+with+OpenVAS" rel="nofollow">OpenVAS </a>(for system vulnerabilities). Note well: Hosts such as Amazon require notification up-front of vulnerability scans. Otherwise, they're unable to differentiate between real and simulated attacks.</p><h1 id="A9:2017-UsingComponentswithKnownVulnerabilities-OtherResources">Other Resources</h1><p>OWASP 2017 full details -  page 15 of <a class="external-link" href="https://www.owasp.org/images/7/72/OWASP_Top_10-2017_%28en%29.pdf.pdf" rel="nofollow">https://www.owasp.org/images/7/72/OWASP_Top_10-2017_%28en%29.pdf.pdf</a></p>
