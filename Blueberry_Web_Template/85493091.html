                    <p>Overview</p><p class="western">Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is an open standard for logging into accounts, where authentication in one context has already taken place and another is requested elsewhere. This means that you are able to login with account &quot;x&quot; on system &quot;y&quot;,&quot;z&quot; etc. The single sign-on login streamlines the process of logging in by only requesting the user to sign in once. In this fashion it saves time and improves security; having one strong account that is remembered, instead of multiple accounts with weaker and more memorable passwords.</p><p class="western">OAuth is an open standard for access delegation, commonly used as a way for Internet users to grant websites or applications access to their information on other websites but without giving them the passwords. This mechanism is used by companies such as Amazon, Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Twitter to permit the users to share information about their accounts with third party applications or websites.<br/><br/></p><p class="western"><strong>SSO Support in BBWT3 (13-05-20)</strong></p><p class="western">Via OAuth</p><ul><li>Google - Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Google</li><li>Facebook -  Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Facebook</li><li>LinkedIn - Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.LinkedIn.</li></ul><p class="western">Configuration for these methods is via the Operation Admin → System Configuration screen in the BBWT3 UI.</p><p class="western"><br/></p><p class="western">Via SAML</p><ul><li class="western">Office 365 - Using the Sustainsys SAML 2 library - <a class="external-link" href="https://github.com/Sustainsys/Saml2" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/Sustainsys/Saml2</a></li><li class="western">Active Directory / ADFS - Using the Sustainsys SAML 2 library - <a class="external-link" href="https://github.com/Sustainsys/Saml2" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/Sustainsys/Saml2</a></li></ul><p class="western">Configuration for these methods is via the Application Settings configuration file (appsettings.json)</p><p class="western"><br/></p><p class="western"><br/></p><h1 class="western" id="BBWT3-SingleSignOn(SSO),SAML&amp;OAuth-TestCase">Test Case</h1><ol><li class="western">A user accesses a remote application (BBWT3).</li><li class="western">The application identifies the user’s origin (such as from IP address).</li><li class="western">The user who is already logged in on one platform - the identity provider, tells the remote application that the user is authenticated.
