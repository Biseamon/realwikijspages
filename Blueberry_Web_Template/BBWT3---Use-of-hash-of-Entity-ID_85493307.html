                    <h1 id="BBWT3-UseofhashofEntityID-Overview">Overview</h1><p>Many pages pass a record ID within the URL - such as page  /users.aspx?id=123 but this exposes the record ID and it is very easy for a hacker to substitute other record ID's here and possibly gain access to additional data.</p><p>It has been agreed to encrypt the record ID with a hashing algorithm, The resulting parameter should be partly human readable to aid with debugging.</p><p>Note: This is NOT a first line of protection. This feature has only been added as a fallback if the standard user level security checks fail.</p><h3 id="BBWT3-UseofhashofEntityID-BBWT3">BBWT3</h3><p>The final design/implementation is to replace the ID with a two part reference made up of the ID and a hashed value.</p><p>Example ... ~/app/demo/orders/edit/1-DA6DEA9A1EA22DA4</p><p><span>The server response to the client will contain two parts - the hashed ID (as above) and just the ID.</span></p><p>In this case, the record ID is 1, and the remaining string is the hash value.<br/>Any hacker attempt to get to record ID 2 would need to get the hash correct for that record.<br/>The hash is salted using a salt based on the type of object. This prevents a hacker using a known hash for ID 1 on &quot;orders&quot; successfully guessing an unknown hash for ID 1 on &quot;employees&quot;.</p><p>There will be some record types where the primary key is not a record ID but may be a GUID as in the case of user records.<br/>In the case of a GUID, there will be no hashing done to the parameter.</p><p>For full details see PTS task <a class="external-link" href="https://ptsa.bbconsult.co.uk/taskEditor?type=3&amp;id=146044" rel="nofollow">146044</a> (31-01-19)</p>
