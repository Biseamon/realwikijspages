<h1>GUI Libraries&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>PrimeNG&nbsp;</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>A free and open-source UI suite for Angular created by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.primefaces.org/">PrimeFaces</a>. Allowing for a wide range of native widgets and components that can be integrated into BBWT3 projects.</p>
<h2>Advantages</h2>
<ul>
  <li>&nbsp;<ul>
      <li>A large number of components are available.</li>
      <li>Open-source and hosted on GitHub.</li>
      <li>Professional premium templates are available.</li>
      <li>Provides a consistent UI.</li>
      <li>UI controls are fully implemented as Angular components.</li>
      <li>Each control has a set of options to change appearance, behaviour, events etc.</li>
      <li>Mobile-friendly and cross-browser compatible.</li>
      <li>Documentation is reasonably good.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Disadvantages</h2>
<ul>
  <li>&nbsp;<ul>
      <li>Despite being well maintained, there are still some bugs with controls and appearance.</li>
      <li>CSS selectors can be difficult to override and rules are often overriding each other, sometimes making it difficult to customise.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Can be quite heavy on browsers when there are lots of controls or complex logic.</li>
</ul>
<h2>FullCalendar</h2>
<p>PrimeNG includes support for the&nbsp;<a href="https://fullcalendar.io/">FullCalendar&nbsp;</a>library and implements it as a control.</p>
<p>However, the&nbsp;<a href="https://fullcalendar.io/scheduler"><strong>scheduler feature</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;is a premium add-on&nbsp;</strong>provided by the FullCalendar developers.</p>
<h2>Premium Templates</h2>
<p>PrimeFaces offer multiple&nbsp;<a href="https://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/theming">premium templates</a>&nbsp;to be used when building applications.</p>
<p>Prices range from around $190-790 depending on the template used. Templates have been known to go on sale (e.g. around Black Friday.)</p>
<h1>Ultima</h1>
<p>BBWT3 currently uses the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.primefaces.org/layouts/ultima-ng/">Ultima theme</a>&nbsp;- the latest version of which can be downloaded through the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.primefaces.org/store/">PrimeFaces store</a>&nbsp;(login details stored in Bitwarden as usual.)</p>
<h2>Advantages</h2>
<ul>
  <li>&nbsp;<ul>
      <li>Works well with PrimeNG components as it was made by the same developers.</li>
      <li>Live demo shows off some potential layouts to be used.</li>
      <li>Good support for mobile devices, menu collapses on small screens.</li>
      <li>SCSS source provided so we can customise and roll our own version if we need to.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Disadvantages</h2>
<ul>
  <li>&nbsp;<ul>
      <li>Support is only provided through a community forum (which is often quiet) but&nbsp;<a href="https://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/support">extra support</a>&nbsp;is paid-for.</li>
      <li>SCSS and CSS rules could do with being a little more efficient (there is a lot of overriding in the rules).</li>
      <li>Can't update from a Git/npm repository, a zip file has to be downloaded and files replaced manually.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>For Project Managers</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Cut down on development time with pre-built and royalty-free components, that can be integrated into your BBWT3 web application.</li>
  <li>Open-source and published under the MIT license; meaning it is available to be modified and published and sold.</li>
  <li>Popular, thus having a large community of support where needed.</li>
  <li>Limitation: no built-in localisation. However they provide abilities to override text through "locale" property.</li>
  <li>Limitation: scheduling component of PrimeNG requires a license.</li>
</ul>
<h2>For Marketing</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Save time and money by using existing technologies that are free to use and modify.</li>
</ul>
