<h1>BBWT1&nbsp;</h1>

<p>Blueberry has invested time in developing the Blueberry Web Template (BBWT). This is a collection of pre-built modules, programming practices and design styles which make it easier to create powerful and easy to use web applications using Microsoft ASP.NET, C# and jQuery.<br><br>A Getting Started on BBWT Development guide can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://svn.bbconsult.co.uk/repository/bbwt/docs/Getting%20Started%20on%20BBWT%20Development.docx">here</a>.<br><br>We have an online demo here - <a href="http://bbwt.demo.bbconsult.co.uk">http://bbwt.demo.bbconsult.co.uk</a> – please contact us for a user/password to access this site.<br><br>For a more detailed overview of the features it supports see the documents in <a href="https://svn.bbconsult.co.uk/repository/bbwt/docs">https://svn.bbconsult.co.uk/repository/bbwt/docs</a> .<br><br>Blueberry has used BBWT on a variety of projects. The first two screenshots below are taken from our demo site:<br><br><strong>Screen shot not available</strong></p>
<p><i>Figure 1&nbsp; Showing the login screen for the system – note recover password feature.</i><br><br>Once the user is logged in they are able to access the system via the top menu.&nbsp; Note that this can be customised and the design changed for any new BBWT site.<br><br>This is the home page for our demo site.&nbsp;&nbsp; Note the header bar now has a welcome and logout message, and a link to the user’s profile.&nbsp; We take care to put the system version number in both the header and footer so that a screenshot of the site shows the version, which helps with debugging<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Screen shot not available</strong></p>
<p><i>Figure 2 – showing the home page.&nbsp; The footer has links to standard pages, the version number and a “Report a Problem” link</i>.<br><br>The screen shots below show examples from a project Blueberry produced for a customer that wanted to control and manage tasks for employees across a series of fast-food restaurants.&nbsp; In this system, the main menu has been redesigned to provide options:&nbsp; Home, Reports, Admin, Client Software. The main ‘System Administration’ page features a Hierarchical control for drilling down through Companies, Regions, Sites into individual units located at a site.&nbsp;&nbsp; This hierarchy UI is very convenient, and has since been re-used on two other systems.<br><br><strong>Screen shot not available</strong></p>
<p><i>Figure 3 Illustrating the use of the Hierarchical control to allow a ‘drill-down’ feel to managing the data for a given company.</i><br><br>The menu system in BBWT is fully customisable and allows for any number of menu items and sub-menu items with any names/text that the project requires. It is an attractive and simple way of navigating around the site.<br><br><strong>Screen shot not available</strong></p>
<p><i>Figure 4 Showing the use of the BBWT menu system to allow the user to easily move around the site from one page to another.</i><br><br>BBWT allows for quite complex forms for data entry. The example below shows a form we used to add tasks to the database. As the figure shows, BBWT allows for data entry via a number of different controls (e.g. text boxes, dropdown lists, checkboxes and calendar controls)<br><br><strong>Screen shot not available</strong></p>
<p><i>Figure 5&nbsp; - Showing a typical BBWT data entry form, with a variety of controls embedded in it.</i><br><br>BBWT has a carefully designed data validation and “hint” system.&nbsp; Any data field on a form can have validation and a hint added.&nbsp; The figure below shows hint mechanism in action.<br><br><strong>Screen shot not available</strong></p>
<p><i>Figure 6 BBWT helps the user fill in form data by suggesting the type/range of data that should be entered.</i><br><br>The example below shows the validation system in action within a form in BBWT. The user has non-numeric data in a numeric-only field. BBWT has trapped the Error when the user pressed Save and told the user why the data cannot be accepted.<br><br><strong>Screen shot not available</strong></p>
<p><i>Figure 7&nbsp; - BBWT Data validation in action on a form Save.</i><br><br>Validation of data in forms in BBWT can be controlled and changed within BBWT itself.&nbsp; Users (or expert system admins) can generate a new validation rule and then apply that rule to various fields within the current system.<br><br><strong>Screen shot not available</strong></p>
<p><i>Figure 8 Showing the facility within BBWT to create a validation rule&nbsp;</i>for a field.<br><br>BBWT has a built in mechanism to allow the testers to give feedback. If a user is working with a form or page and notices something they would like to question or comment on within the page itself, they can do this by clicking on the pushpin icon:<br><br>..in the bottom RHS of the page. This brings up a form that the user can fill in with their comments. They can then drag the pushpin icon to point to the item in question on the page. The example below show this:<br><br><strong>Screen shot not available</strong></p>
<p><i>Figure 9&nbsp; Showing the user making use of the feedback feature to highlight an issue on a form that they would like to question. When the user has</i><br><br>filled in the form and pressed OK, the information can be sent back to a development/integration team and logged in an issue tracking system.<br><br>Note:&nbsp; this facility could be enabled for end users, but is generally used only during system testing.</p>
