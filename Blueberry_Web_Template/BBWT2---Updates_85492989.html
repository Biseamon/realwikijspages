                    <p><strong>Updated 1st December 2014</strong></p><p>We’ve currently got quite a lot of work in progress on BBWT2. This is partly due to a lack of management-time checking over the work and suggesting improvements.</p><p>We didn’t get the focus on BBWT2 that we were aiming for since the last status update. Instead BBWT2-core developers were used on live BBWT2 projects instead and have stayed on those projects longer than originally planned. I expect work on the BBWT2 core will continue to be very slow for the next month or two.</p><p>We have seen the first use of Instant Reports features on a live project. It’s been a bit of a stumbling start as the work was not fully complete, and we do not have the full intended feature-set. However, the eventual results are fairly pleasing. Pleasing to me at least – ask John Davies for a second opinion.</p><p>A review of the site security on BBWT2 is overdue. I’m hoping to investigate deeply this month. Please be aware that the BBWT2 example code contained an insecure webservice that did not require user authentication before delivering data. This should be fixed in the example code this month. If you are managing a BBWT2 project please do have a developer check that your project didn’t copy this bad practice.</p><p>There has been no recent work on the BBWT1-core; the project is effectively stopped. If you’re planning a new BBWT1 project please do let me know.</p><p>Where I’ve marked something as “First draft implemented” in the table below, you can expect it to be a usable base to develop from but not something you would be happy showing to a customer without first testing and fixing.</p>
