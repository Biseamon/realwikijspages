<h1>BBWT3 - Environments/Server Instances&nbsp;</h1>
<p>Created by Jason Cozza on Sep 21, 2020</p>
<p>We currently run three environments for BBWT3 on AWS:</p>

<p>There is also a link to these environments from&nbsp;<a href="https://bbwt3.blueberrytest.com/">https://bbwt3.blueberrytest.com/</a></p>
<p>To help reduce costs, the above environments use spot capacity and are scheduled to run during work hours.</p>
<p>The administration portal for the above environments can be accessed using&nbsp;<a href="https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/home?region=eu-west-1#/application/overview?applicationName=Blueberry%20Web%20Template%203">this link</a>&nbsp;(ask a sysadmin for access).</p>

<h2>Load balancer</h2>
<p>In order to provide HTTPS service to the above instances, a single load balancer is used to route traffic between elastic beanstalk environments via target groups. This load balancer and target groups are not part of the elastic beanstalk configurations, so must be managed separately.</p>

<p>The target groups are added to the appropriate auto-scaling group, which then automatically registers instances to the target group and the load balancer so that traffic is routed appropriately.</p>
<p>Target groups are configured to check the&nbsp;<strong>/api/health</strong>&nbsp;endpoint for a 200 response to indicate a healthy target.</p>
<p>Stickiness is not enabled on the load balancer.</p>
<p>HTTP&nbsp;→ HTTPS redirects are handled within the Kestrel web server via the&nbsp;<strong>ENABLE_HTTPS_REDIRECT</strong>&nbsp;environment variable.</p>
<p>For each environment, a Route 53 ALIAS A record is used to map the DNS names to the load balancer.</p>
<h2>Known issues</h2>
<h3>test-linux-aurora</h3>
<p>Occasionally, the hosting instance will run out of disk space as it does not clear out older deployed versions from the same instance.</p>
<p>This is normally not an issue as the instances are recreated every day due to their scheduled nature.</p>
<p>To remedy this, simply terminate the current running instance for that environment and Elastic Beanstalk will replace it.</p>
<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3>Linux</h3>
<p>Application logs from stdout can be fetched using the Elastic Beanstalk logs tab.</p>
<h3>Windows</h3>
<p>System logs (event viewer etc.) can be fetched using the Elastic Beanstalk logs tab.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can connect to the instance using the appropriate keypair stored in BitWarden.</p>
<p>For the Windows demo system, use the BitWarden note 'BBWT3 Elastic Beanstalk Demo Windows Keypair'.</p>
<p>For the Windows test system, use the BitWarden note 'BBWT3 Elastic Beanstalk Test Windows Keypair'.</p>
<p>To connect, find the current running instance using the AWS console and note the current IP address. Right click the instance and click 'get windows password' and select the keypair taken from BitWarden when prompted. Now use these details in your RDP client to connect to the running instance.</p>
<p>Once connected, you can examine the logs in the logs directory relative to the application root (C:\inetpub\AspNetCoreWebApps\bbwt3). You can also attempt to start the application in a terminal window using a Powershell window in the application root:</p>
<figure class="table">
  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><code>$env:ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT="test-windows-aurora"</code>&nbsp;<code>#&nbsp;Substitute as appropriate</code><br><code>$env:Serilog__MinimumLevel__Default="Error"</code>&nbsp;<code>#&nbsp;Restrict logging to errors only</code><br><code>dotnet BBWT.Web.dll</code></td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</figure>
<p>You can see the errors in the terminal window, or check the logs directory.</p>
