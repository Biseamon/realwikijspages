<h1>Blueberry Group : BBWT3 - Two Factor Authentication - TOTP (Google Authentication), U2F&nbsp;</h1>
<p>Created by Jason Cozza on Sep 21, 2020</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>2FA (Two Factor Authentication) utilises one-time only passwords in conjunction with the user's standard username and password to login .&nbsp; This can be achieved via software ie. TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) authenticator app (such as Google Authenticator), or via hardware (U2F). It improves security by adding an additional layer to the verification process to prevent unauthorised access.</p>
<p>User logs in with username and password, then is prompted to complete two factor authentication with the method that has been set up.</p>
<ul>
  <li>If the 2FA device is no longer accessible,&nbsp;2FA can be removed through the use of a recovery code.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Limitations</p>
<p><strong>U2F is currently disabled when BBWT3 is installed on a Linux server, because the U2F server side library is not working yet on Linux because&nbsp;ECDsaCng is not supported.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We need to stay tuned :&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://github.com/brucedog/U2F_Core/issues/13"><strong>https://github.com/brucedog/U2F_Core/issues/13</strong></a></p>
<p>There may be some differences between the current UI and the screenshots, as BBWT may get updated, but the instructions are identical.</p>
<h1>Test Case</h1>
<ol>
  <li>Admin user receives malicious email with a link to a phishing website.</li>
  <li>User follows link and attempts to use login credentials.</li>
  <li>Attacker now has both username and password of the admin user.</li>
  <li>Attacker attempts to login to real site with stolen credentials.</li>
  <li>Attacker is unable to successfully login due to not having the one time only password, generated by two factor authentication.</li>
</ol>
<h1>For Testers</h1>
<h1>For Project Managers</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Two factor authentication provides additional security on accounts by utilising one time only passwords in conjunction with a username and password.</li>
  <li>2FA helps prevent phishing attacks from being successful as even if a users account and password are compromised, this information is useless to an attacker as they do not have physical access to the TOTP device associated with the account.</li>
  <li>Alternately the use of Universal 2<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;Factor (U2F) physical keys such as FIDO can be used instead as the two step authentication. They work in a similar manner to Google Authenticator but have a physical button to be pressed at time of login.</li>
  <li>The enhanced security features will make accounts more protected and thus the business as a whole.</li>
  <li>However users must still be educated to be security conscious. Inserting unverified USB keys into work computers still poses a significant security risk.</li>
  <li>Both of these methods introduce a further step that the user must complete before being able to access their account. This may initially cause confusion with end users, but they will soon become used to the additional step.</li>
  <li>Limitation: The U2F method currently is not supported if BBWT3 is installed on a Linux server.</li>
</ul>
<h1>For Marketing</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Uses modern security practices - one time only passwords.</li>
  <li>Emerging popularity in the mainstream for such technology.</li>
  <li>Highly resilient to phishing attacks - even if an attacker has a username and password, without the code from the Authenticator app or the physical hardware USB (e.g FIDO), they cannot access the account.</li>
</ul>
