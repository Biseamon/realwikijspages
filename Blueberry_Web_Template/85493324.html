<h1>Blueberry Group : A6:2017 - Security Misconfiguration&nbsp;</h1>
<p>Created by Jason Cozza on Sep 22, 2020</p>
<h1>Overview<br>&nbsp;</h1>
<p>According to OWASP, Security Misconfiguration is the most commonly seen issue. Strong security requires a good and secure configuration set and deployed for apps, frameworks, servers, database, and custom code, and all should be kept up to date. Otherwise, the flaws to come as a result can be exploited by attackers and will allow them to access privileged data. Proper configuration of an application’s entire environment needs to be defined, implemented, and regulated or it may lead to severe security holes.</p>
<h1>Example</h1>
<p>The application server’s configuration allows detailed error messages, e.g. stack traces, to be returned to users.</p>
<p>This potentially exposes sensitive information or underlying flaws such as component versions that are known to be vulnerable.</p>
<p>The attacker then uses this information to launch an attack against the server or web application.</p>
<h1>How BBWT3 Mitigates This Vulnerability</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Uses up to date components and technologies.</li>
  <li>Does not display detailed information on error pages - as these can be used to gain information for an attack.<br><br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>BBWT3 uses the most up to date versions of the components and technologies used. This ensure that BBWT3 continues to be a modern and secure platform on which to build your web application. For example, new versions of a component called Angular come out with patches almost every week, and major releases every 6 months. We keep track of updates and ensure they are included into BBWT3, to help keep your web application free from vulnerabilities of older versions of components.</p>
<p>We do not use verbose error pages when a user encounters an error with the application. This is because the more information contained in the error page, such as stack trace, directories or version numbers, can help an attacker gain information. Information that can be used against the web application or server.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ideally, privileged access control to the server should be limited to system administrators, not developers. This is supported in BBWT3 with expertise in server configuration built-up through the use of automated configuration and deployment tools.</p>
