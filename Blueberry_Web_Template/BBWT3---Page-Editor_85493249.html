                    <h1 id="BBWT3-PageEditor-Overview">Overview</h1><p>Custom applications need ways to guide end-users. However, writing a manual or online help is a significant investment – and if an application is changing rapidly, writing the help can be a never-ending task.</p><p> Blueberry’s view is that help should be delivered in two ways:</p><ul><li>As tooltips within the application, which give users immediate guidance and examples of what data is expected in a control.</li><li>As a separate help file which is organised by task or process – so “How to Create a User”.</li></ul><p>We see less value in creating screen-by-screen help pages – well, until it can be automatically generated.</p><p>As a first step in automating system help documentation, BBWT3 includes an interactive tooltip feature:</p><ul><li>Developers include (i) icons next to controls.</li><li>An administrator with the right permission can edit the text for these tooltips interactively directly within the application.</li><li>The text of the tooltips is automatically sent back to be included in system source code.</li></ul><p>Why is this useful? Tooltip text generally needs to be specified by the customer, because it is the customer’s system and they have the domain knowledge.  In previous systems, customers would have to go through and write a long list of the tooltip texts and send to us to include. This was a time-consuming process. By automating this process we save a lot of time, and make it easier to ensure that we have good, strong tooltips in place.<br/>Tooltips are being replaced by a HTML editor, where you can enter a basic HTML editor and create or edit the text for prompts or tooltips.</p><h1 class="western" id="BBWT3-PageEditor-TestCase">Test Case</h1><ol><li>The web application has been fully developed and is online for client.</li><li>Client admin gets feedback about web application from users.</li><li>Users need clarification on a feature.</li><li>Admin can create a tooltip icon and description next to the feature.</li><li>Client does not need to spend time and money on developers to do this.</li></ol><h1 class="western" id="BBWT3-PageEditor-ForTesters">For Testers</h1><ol><li>From the BBWT3 menu click on &quot;Operational Admin&quot;.</li><li>From the drop down menu click on &quot;Menu Configuration&quot;.</li><li>Under &quot;Footer Menu&quot; in the grid click on the &quot;i&quot; icon next to &quot;Order&quot;.</li></ol><h1 class="western" id="BBWT3-PageEditor-ForProjectManagers">For Project Managers</h1><ul><li>Ability to have notes on features.</li><li>Have relevant information available on screen right next to a feature or section.</li><li>Empowers users.</li><li>Admins can make changes and use custom text without the need to contact a developer.</li></ul><h1 class="western" id="BBWT3-PageEditor-ForMarketing">For Marketing</h1><ul><li>Help icon's to give out extra information on a feature that a user might not know how to use.</li></ul>
