                    <p>The BBWT2 demonstration now contains an Admin menu item titled &quot;Manage Languages&quot;,</p><p><br/>There are no complete localisations of the BBWT2 site as this would be prohibitively expensive, but we do have a few snippets of localised data and you can add your own as necessary.<br/><br/>Adding a language is a fairly straightforward affair:</p><ul><li>Hit Add at the Manage Languages page</li><li>Enter the ISO code for the language that you want to add</li><li>Enter the name of the language as you want it to appear in language pickers</li><li>Pick the &quot;culture&quot; file to be used with that language from those uploaded. The culture files are used by third party frameworks [1].</li></ul><p>Once you have a language added you next to need to send a file containing the strings for translation to a translation company. In the meantime, when the language is picked, we will show the English localisation for that language.<br/><br/>To create the file, simply hit Export the selected language at the Manage Languages page. You will receive a CSV file containing all the strings used in the system. This includes menu items and other dynamically added BBWT features [2]. There are three columns in the file. The first one is the identifier for the key, the second shows the English localisation, the third column is the one that needs replacing with the localised text.<br/><br/>Once a localised file has been returned from the translation company it is a simple matter to Import the file at the Manage Languages page.<br/><br/>You will be warned if there have been subsequent changes, that require a further update, but BBWT2 will accept as much of the file as is usable.</p><hr/><p> </p><p>When working with localisations you may find the following information about the demonstration site helpful:</p><ul><li>Where no other choice has been made, the browser preferences decide which language is presented</li></ul><ul><li>A language picker is shown in the footer before login</li></ul><ul><li>After login, that picker is hidden, but you can access another picker via the preferences set on the user profile. The user profile is accessed on the Welcome link next to the log out button</li></ul><ul><li>On the Demo Pages menu there is a Culture page showing how dates, times, currency, et cetera, are handled.[3]</li></ul><p> </p><hr/><p><br/>Based on previous work preparing an existing BBWT2 site for localisation can be done at a rate of 3-4 pages per developer hour – provided that you don’t make the developer test the pages himself. The testing work should be given to a tester for cost control.<br/><br/>It’s important to tell developers working on this about point 2 of <a class="external-link" href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/07/18/12-commandments-software-localization/" rel="nofollow">http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/07/18/12-commandments-software-localization/</a> - &quot;substitution not concatenation&quot;. You’ll also want to make use of the “fake” localisation feature we added to help catch any such errors missed by the developers.</p><hr/><p><br/>We have not yet done any work on any localisation for a language that is not left-to-right top-to-bottom. There are significant changes to the UI that are appropriate for such languages. We don't know yet what costs will be incurred in supporting languages with a different writing direction.</p><hr/><p><br/>[1] In the rare case that the culture file you want isn't already in the list, you will need to separately arrange for the new localisation of the culture file, commit it through SVN, deploy it, then proceed as above.<br/><br/>[2] With the exception of BBWT reports. Localisation of BBWT reports is currently deferred to a later phase.<br/><br/>[3] In this phase of development all locale details are inferred from language selection.</p>
