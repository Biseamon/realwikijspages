These are checked against known common passwords that would be amongst the first for an attacker to attempt.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><a href="85493320.html">A3:2017-Sensitive Data Exposure</a></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Web applications often process sensitive data. This might be data that is confidential to a business, or it might be personal identifiable information (perhaps particularly sensitive data such as financial or healthcare data).</p><p>Of special interest are passwords. Many users choose to use the same password to protect their accounts with multiple different organisations. A weakness in the protection of passwords at one server can impact on sites with higher risk profiles.</p><p>There are two concerns here:</p><ol><li>An attacker compromises the network on which the data is communicated back and forth, making copies of the sensitive data.</li><li>An attacker extracts a copy of the database by direct access to the server.</li></ol><p>Example outcome: A user using compromised public wifi inadvertently allows an attacker to access their user account.</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Communications between browser and website are protected by encryption through HTTPS.</p><p>Optional database encryption mitigates against attackers with direct access to the database files.</p><p>Passwords are given special attention. Rather than store the password itself we store a token derived from the password. The chosen algorithms make it simple to verify a password emits the same token, but exceedingly hard to work backwards from the token to guess the password. In technical terms we use individually salted hashes of the passwords with PBKDF2 encryption.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><a href="85493318.html">A4:2017-XML External Entities (XXE)</a></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>When communicating between browser and web server, the data must be encoded in a format that both ends can interpret. One encoding that has been particularly popular is &quot;XML&quot;. However, XML has a feature that effectively instructs the interpreter to reference data elsewhere and continue interpretation. An attacker can send the server XML data purporting to be the data for a filled form. Older, or poorly configured, XML interpreters accept embedded instructions to reference other files without consideration of the possible result.</p><p>Example outcome: The interpretation of the XML data causes the contents of server files to be disclosed. The contents reveal further weaknesses in the server configuration.</p></td><td class="confluenceTd">The data-transfer architecture is based on JSON rather than XML. This is a simpler encoding format that is not vulnerable to this form of attack.</td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><a href="85493322.html">A5:2017-Broken Access Control</a></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Access control architecture determines which users are permitted to perform which actions.</p><p>There can be a gap between the intended access control and the proper implementation of that access control.</p><p>For instance, access control might erroneously rely on an expectation that links offered to the browser by the server will be the only ones addressed.</p><p>Example outcome: An attacker with a user account is able to access sensitive data belonging to another user.</p><p>Example outcome: An attacker is able to access features intended only for administrative users.</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>The design of access control under BBWT3 denies access to a feature until explicitly coded otherwise. Access control is supported by an architecture assigning users to roles that permit access to specific feature-sets. And, at a finer-level, by supporting access rules that control access to individual resources within a feature-set.</p><p>We provide verifiability of roles-based access control through the &quot;Routes Access&quot; page.</p><p>For administrative access, there is the option to restrict use to certain fixed IP addresses - effectively requiring the administrative user to be at a specific physical location.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><a href="85493324.html">A6:2017-Security Misconfiguration</a></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Security misconfiguration can happen at any level of the application &quot;stack&quot;. A web application's security relies not just on its own code, but also on network services, operating systems, databases, and technical platforms or libraries such as ASP.NET and Angular.</p><p>Of special interest is the security configuration relating to application error messages. Older, or poorly configured, web sites assist the developer in understanding an error by providing valuable diagnostic information on an error to the browser - however, that diagnostic information is also useful to an attacker.</p><p>Example outcome: An attacker is able to query the database directly, bypassing the web site, by manipulating a flaw in network communication protocols.</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Where acceptable to the customer, privileged access control to the server is limited to system administrators. Expertise in server configuration is built-up through the use of automated configuration tools.</p><p>Error pages don't contain detailed technical information that might reveal configuration details. Instead, this data is internally logged against the error. This takes the user, or the attacker, out of the loop for sensitive information.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><a href="85493326.html">A7:2017-Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</a></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>An attacker enters hostile data into the website to trick the web server into passing it along to another user's browser.</p><p>XSS flaws occur when the browser's interpreters cannot correctly distinguish which parts of a web server's response are untrusted input data and which parts are a trusted command to the browser.</p><p>Example outcome: An attacker is able to trick an administrative user's browser into executing unwanted instructions, using feature-sets that are intended to be restricted to the administrative user.</p><p>Historical note: Popular sites used to be vulnerable to attacks on browser interpreter issues. Attackers developed special &quot;attack&quot; web-sites that redirected visitors to those popular sites. The redirection was crafted so that the popular site immediately caused the browser to execute the unwanted instructions under the user's account at that popular site. When the vulnerability was discovered, the term &quot;cross-site&quot; was coined. As time passed, the term &quot;cross-site&quot; began to apply to the browser interpreter issue rather than the redirection.</p></td><td class="confluenceTd">BBWT3 uses the Angular framework, which handles this concern by design. Angular takes a trusted template of HTML and script from the server, and then any further input is interpreted as data for the browser and not as commands for the browser to execute.</td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><a href="85493328.html">A8:2017-Insecure Deserialisation</a></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>When communicating between browser and web server, the data must be encoded in a format that both ends can interpret. The act of taking data from an input source such as a network connection is called &quot;deserialisation&quot;.</p><p>There are two concerns here:</p><ol><li>When the data format is complex, a weaknesses in the server's interpreters can turn interpretation of hostile data into unintended execution of code on the server.</li><li>Web applications may require the web server send data to the browser to be temporarily stored and returned on the browser's next request. This technique allows the server to avoid otherwise costly look-ups in its own storage. This technique can be used with access control data. If there is an absence of tamper-proofing this can allow an attacker to substitute their own assertions about what they are permitted to access.</li></ol><p>Example outcome: An attacker uploads a 42 kilobyte zip file which an old and vulnerable zip file interpreter deserialises into 4.5 petabytes of data, temporarily overloading the server and preventing legitimate users from accessing the site.</p><p>Example outcome: An attacker is able to access features intended only for administrative users.</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>The data-transfer architecture in BBWT3 is based on JSON. This is a simple encoding format that provides some protection from deserialisation attacks. Further protection is provided by a Data Transfer Object layer which specifies expectations on the incoming data and rejects data that doesn't conform.</p><p>BBWT3 takes the following steps to protect access control tokens: (a) applies encryption to deter attacker's investigation of the token contents on their own machine, (b) provides encryption over the network to deter interception of the token, (c) refuses access control tokens that are old so as to make excessive brute-force computation to break the encryption infeasible (d) provides tamper-proofing through a key and hashing algorithm that demonstrates that the server has &quot;signed&quot; that the data has originated with it, and not elsewhere.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><a href="85493330.html">A9:2017-Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities</a></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Not only must a server be securely configured, but as weaknesses are discovered by the community, security fixes must be applied in a timely fashion.</p><p>Example outcome: Due to a fault in an older version of a JavaScript library, an attacker is able to use an XSS attack to trick an administrative user's browser into executing unwanted instructions, despite the application's steps to prevent that.</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Ongoing BBWT3 development stays abreast with the latest versions of components used.</p><p>Where agreed in support plans, Blueberry can provide system administration in keeping servers up to date with the latest security fixes.</p><p>Optionally, we can also provide periodic testing with vulnerability scanning tools such as Acunetix and OpenVAS.</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" class="confluenceTd"><a href="85493332.html">A10:2017-Insufficient Logging &amp; Monitoring</a></td><td colspan="1" class="confluenceTd"><p>When many attacks occur, they are not initially noticed.</p><p>There are two concerns here:</p><ol><li>If there is insufficient active monitoring of the web application, then the attacker has plenty of time to refine their attack. Industry surveys suggest that it is far from unusual for an attacker to have six months head start before their attack is discovered. It is only once discovery has occurred that the attacker must begin to work against an active opponent.</li><li>If there is insufficient logging of the web application, then it will be unclear what the attacker has damaged and what data has been compromised. The cost of 'blindly' mitigating against all attacks that could have been performed is substantially higher than the costs of a mitigating against the details of a well-understood attack.</li></ol></td><td colspan="1" class="confluenceTd"><p>Optionally, BBWT3 supports both Google's ReCAPTCHA technology, Amazon's AWS Shield Advanced, and similar tools for that mitigate against attacks and importantly notify the application administrators that an attack has been detected.</p><p>BBWT3 uses extensive in-built logging processes delivering logs to an external logserver. Specifically, we use GrayLog for its powerful search features.</p><p>BBWT3 also supports an auditing interface which allows site administrators to view login events and actions taken through the web site.</p><p><br/></p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p><br/></p>
