This counts down, and at the end of the time the system will redirect to the login page.</p><p>For security reasons BBWT3 automatically logs a user out after 10 minutes by default. This can be altered to the desired length depending on the users needs and risk assessment. Session timeout is set in minutes with a minimum of 1 minute allowed for session expiry. The counter is stored and runs down client side.</p><ul><li>After user has been idle for a designated period of idle time allowed, user will be presented with &quot;You will be logged out in (X)&quot; seconds. It is reset if there is mouse movement.</li><li>If user does not interact after this message is displayed and the countdown reaches &quot;0&quot;, the user will be logged out.</li></ul><p class="title"><br/></p><div class="confluence-information-macro confluence-information-macro-warning"><span class="aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-error confluence-information-macro-icon"></span><div class="confluence-information-macro-body"><p class="title"><strong>(31-01-19)</strong></p><p>Currently a user is issued with an access token that does not expire for 14 days. As long as the user does not log out or time out then changes to that users permission will not occur until the access token has expired.</p><p>This should be changed to just a few minutes, a user should also be given a refresh token which permits you to refresh the access token without having to log back in again which can be longer - using a sliding window (where the refresh token will be refreshed each time there is user activity on the web application).</p></div></div><p><br/></p><h1 id="BBWT3-SessionExpiry-TestCase">Test Case</h1><ol><li>User is in a public place.</li><li>User logs into web app.</li><li>User leaves computer unattended.</li><li>Session expires and user is automatically logged out.</li><li>An attacker attempts to take advantage of unattended computer.</li><li>Attacker finds that the account is logged out.</li><li>Account security maintained.</li></ol><h1 id="BBWT3-SessionExpiry-ForTesters">For Testers</h1><ol><li>Login as admin and follow instructions for <a href="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/display/BLUEB/Session+Handling" rel="nofollow">Session Handling</a> to activate session time out and set length.</li><li>Login as user and wait for the set length to draw near.</li><li>30 seconds before session expires, a message should appear at the top of the screen.</li><li>After message countdown decreases to 0 user will be logged out. </li></ol><h1 class="western" id="BBWT3-SessionExpiry-ForProjectManagers">For Project Managers</h1><ul><li>Having a timeout for sessions, improves security for when the user is away from keyboard.
