<h1>New Project Checklist&nbsp;</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Project Managers</h2>
<p>When creating a new BBWT3 project, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Ensure that a PTS project exists, otherwise create one</li>
  <li>Decide which BBWT3 version to use:<ol>
      <li>Latest stable branch (recommended)</li>
      <li>Current development branch (higher risk)</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Raise a PTS task with Sysadmins asking them to: Create a new Gitlab project by forking BBWT3 code. Reference which branch you require.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Sysadmins</h2>
<p>This article is incomplete and may have incorrect information.</p>
<p><br>When creating a new BBWT3 based project, run through the following checklist:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fork the project into the Blueberry namespace (this might require you to fork it into a private namespace, rename, then transfer to the blueberry namespace).</li>
  <li>Create any required infrastructure for the project.<ul>
      <li>What kind of deployment target is required? Is it a single server or load balanced? Will the DB be on the same server as the application or on RDS?</li>
      <li>If using a single server, consider using the latest BBWT3 based&nbsp;<a href="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=1507560">AMI</a>&nbsp;which has a database ready to use.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Prepare any AWS keys that the application requires, e.g:<ul>
      <li>IAM user with S3/SES permissions</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Disable CI/CD in the project settings until the CI file has been updated for the project.</li>
  <li>Adjust the CI/CD as appropriate, to be able to deploy to any infrastructure you've created for this project.</li>
  <li>Adjust the SonarQube configuration in the repository:<ul>
      <li>The key&nbsp;SONARQUBE_KEY in gitlab-ci.yml should be changed so that is a&nbsp;<strong>new&nbsp;</strong>key, not yet used on SonarQube.</li>
      <li>The property sonar.projectName in SonarQube.Analysis.xml&nbsp;be changed so that is a&nbsp;<strong>new&nbsp;</strong>name, not yet used on SonarQube.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Store any secrets (logins, passwords, etc.) in BitWarden.</li>
  <li>Add any secrets to the CI/CD variables settings for the project, and reference them correctly in the CI file.</li>
  <li>Once the CI file is ready, re-enable CI/CD in the project settings.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
