                    <p>BBWT, or Blueberry Web Template, is a collection of standard modules, web pages, design styles, and programming practices which allow us to rapidly create new web applications. This is the second version of BBWT, running on technology that promotes higher quality of code and much greater application responsiveness.<br/><br/>The technologies that BBWT2 is built upon are listed below with a very short description. Later in the document this is followed up by a few paragraphs of explanation for each. If you are a developer, the details you will need for learning about these technologies can be found at <a href="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/wiki/bbwt2-learning-resources/" rel="nofollow">https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/wiki/bbwt2-learning-resources/</a> .<br/><br/>Client–side technologies</p><ul><li>TypeScript – This is an open-source extension of JavaScript developed by Microsoft. We use it within BBWT2 as it provides code completion in Visual Studio and stronger type-checking. i.e. it helps developers write code faster and with fewer errors.</li></ul><ul><li>AngularJS – The way we present pages, and the details of how the user operates within a page, is coded upon this JavaScript framework. It’s developed by Google. It handles much more work at the client’s browser than sites developed with traditional techniques. This results in a much more responsive user experience, i.e. fewer long waits for pages to arrive from the server.</li></ul><ul><li>Kendo UI – This is a toolkit of generally applicable controls such as grids, menus, drop-down lists, etc. BBWT2 code, written in AngularJS calls upon these controls. Kendo UI is developed by Telerik.</li></ul><p><br/>Server–side technologies</p><ul><li>NET Web API – The data we choose to present and the business rules we choose to apply is coded upon this framework. It’s developed by Microsoft. This is the server-end of the picture. It provides an interface to the database. Used properly, it will allow appropriate caching of the results from querying a server and reduce load on the server.</li></ul><ul><li>ODATA – A protocol that ASP.NET Web API provides for simple conversations with the database. ODATA is developed by Microsoft. ODATA allows very simple interface for requests to Create, Read, Update, and Delete. The simplicity and general usefulness of the interface makes it very suitable for connecting to Kendo UI grids. This reduces the amount of new code that must be written for each page.</li></ul><h2 id="BBWT2-TechnologyOverviewforManagers-Typescript">Typescript</h2><hr/><ul><li>TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.</li></ul><ul><li>Typescript starts from the syntax and semantics that millions of JavaScript developers know today.</li></ul><ul><li>With TypeScript, you can use existing JavaScript code, incorporate popular JavaScript libraries, and be called from other JavaScript code.</li></ul><ul><li>TypeScript compiles to clean, simple JavaScript code which runs on our BBWT2 target browsers (plus some others). BBWT2 aims to be compatible with IE9 onwards, Firefox, Safari and Chrome.</li></ul><ul><li>Types enable TypeScript developers to use highly-productive development tools and practices: static checking, symbol-based navigation, statement completion, and code refactoring. These types are optional.</li></ul><ul><li>Type inference allows a few type annotations to make a big difference to the static verification of your code.</li></ul><ul><li>Starting point for learning more: <a class="external-link" href="http://www.typescriptlang.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.typescriptlang.org/</a></li></ul><h2 id="BBWT2-TechnologyOverviewforManagers-AngularJS">AngularJS</h2><hr/><ul><li>HTML is great for declaring static documents, but problems arise when it used for declaring dynamic views in web-applications. AngularJS lets you extend HTML vocabulary. The resulting environment is expressive, readable, and quick to develop.</li></ul><ul><li>Other frameworks deal with HTML’s shortcomings by either abstracting away HTML, CSS, and/or JavaScript or by providing an imperative way for manipulating the DOM. Neither of these address the root problem that HTML was not designed for dynamic views.</li></ul><ul><li>It is fully extensible and works well with other libraries. Every feature can be modified or replaced to suit development needs. AngularJS is a toolset for building the framework suited to your application development.</li></ul><ul><li>AngularJS works particularly nicely with a REST API (see comments below about ASP.NET Web API and REST for more details)</li></ul><ul><li>Starting point for learning more: <a class="external-link" href="https://angularjs.org/" rel="nofollow">https://angularjs.org/</a></li></ul><h2 id="BBWT2-TechnologyOverviewforManagers-KendoUI"> Kendo UI</h2><hr/><ul><li>A ‘complete’ set of HTML5 widgets, 70+ in the professional edition.</li></ul><ul><li>Supports adaptive mobile rendering, touch screen interaction.</li></ul><ul><li>Recently made AngularJS directives a part of its core product.</li></ul><ul><li>The company changed pricing models in 2014. As of October 2014 BBWT2 is running on an older free ( GPLv3 licensed ) edition. The business case for a change to the most recent professional edition is frequently reviewed though there is no compelling case at present. Some of the features that we relied upon in the previous free edition are now considered professional features, most notably the grid widget. Telerik bug fixes and the possibility of opening support tickets with Telerik would come with an update to the new professional edition. The professional edition comes with a hefty price tag: $699 per developer, though there may be room for negotiation in bulk.</li></ul><p> </p><ul><li>Starting points for learning more: <a class="external-link" href="http://www.telerik.com/kendo-ui" rel="nofollow">http://www.telerik.com/kendo-ui</a> and <a class="external-link" href="http://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/" rel="nofollow">http://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/</a></li></ul><h2 id="BBWT2-TechnologyOverviewforManagers-ASP.NETWebAPI">ASP.NET Web API</h2><hr/><ul><li>ASP.NET is intended for building standards-based websites with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. In BBWT2 we developing using the most popular server-side ASP.NET choice, C#.</li></ul><ul><li>ASP.NET Web API is a framework that makes it easy to build HTTP services that reach a broad range of clients, including browsers and mobile devices.</li></ul><ul><li>ASP.NET Web API is an ideal platform for building RESTful applications on the .NET Framework. That’s one that:<br/><br/><ul><li>Identifies data by URL - in addition to <em>presentation</em> of the data</li></ul><br/><ul><li>Requires no state information at the server to process any browser request (beyond who the user is and what they are permitted to do)</li></ul><br/><ul><li>Uses server responses that indicate the degree to which the response may be cached</li></ul><br/><ul><li>Avoids passing knowledge to the browser of which server resources are actually doing the work - so as to make scalability and load-balancing more feasible</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>Starting point for learning more: <a class="external-link" href="http://www.asp.net/web-api" rel="nofollow">http://www.asp.net/web-api</a></li></ul><h2 id="BBWT2-TechnologyOverviewforManagers-ODATA">ODATA</h2><hr/><ul><li>The Open Data Protocol (OData) enables the creation and consumption of REST APIs, which allow resources, to be published and edited by Web clients using simple HTTP messages.</li></ul><ul><li>Each REST command is a POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, or DELETE HTTP request (mapping to CRUD) where the specifics of the command are in the URL.<br/><br/><ul><li>GET: Get a collection of entities (as a feed document) or a single entity (as an entry document).</li></ul><br/><ul><li>POST: Create a new entity from an entry document.</li></ul><br/><ul><li>PUT: Update an existing entity with an entry document.</li></ul><br/><ul><li>PATCH: Update an existing entity with a partial entry document.</li></ul><br/><ul><li>DELETE: Remove an entity.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>OData provides full metadata of the datasource.
