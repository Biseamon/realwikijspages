<h1>Blueberry Group : What is included in the Customer Portal?&nbsp;</h1>
<p>Created by Jason Cozza on Aug 24, 2020</p>
<p>This feature allows customers to log in and review the status of their project - they login through the same URL as BB employees (<a href="http://pts.bbconsult.co.uk">pts.bbconsult.co.uk</a>)<br><br>Customers will have specific permissions set that allow them limited access to PTS - these can be customised as necessary to give more or less access on a customer by customer basis.<br><br>Features that the customer does not have access to will simply be hidden from them.</p>
