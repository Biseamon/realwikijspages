<h1>How can a Manager change a Developer's working hours?&nbsp;</h1>
<p>Created by Jason Cozza on Aug 24, 2020</p>
<p>A developer's expected working hours and working mode (ie full time or part time), are set on their employee page in PTS under the 'Billing Details' tab.<br><br>If the developers working mode is set to 'Full Time', the working hours will always be set to 40 hours and the box cannot be edited to change this.<br><br>However, if the the developer is 'Part Time', the working hours box can be edited to manually set how many hours they are expected to work.</p>
