<h1>Blueberry Group : How do I use Excel to Import and Export Tasks?&nbsp;</h1>
<p>Created by Jason Cozza on Aug 24, 2020</p>
<p>PTS allows the tasks for a project to be imported for and exported to .xls files.</p>
<h2>XLS File Creation</h2>
<hr>
<p>Download the task xls template file from&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/download/attachments/1507467/task-import-template.xls?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1453396055570&amp;api=v2">here</a>.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Enter the project name and code where indicated by 'xxxxx' and enter the project shortcode as the worksheet name (also indicated by 'xxxxx')</li>
  <li>Leave the Task ID column blank - this will allow the new tasks to be allocated a task number during the upload process</li>
  <li>Use the Level 1 - 5 columns to create the tree structure using the names of each task</li>
  <li>Enter any additional information into the other columns provided. Please note - where a reference to an employee is required (Responsible, Team, etc), enter their Short Name<br><br>&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p><br>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Uploading the XLS File</h2>
<hr>
<p>To upload the tasks in PTS:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Login to PTS</li>
  <li>Go to the All Tasks page for the appropriate project</li>
  <li>Click the 'Import' button</li>
  <li>Select the xls file</li>
  <li>Click the 'Send Stats Report' checkbox - this will notify you when the upload is complete and of any errors that have occurred during upload.</li>
  <li>Click OK</li>
</ol>
<p>Alternatively, to upload the tasks by email attach the xls to an email (note - only one attachment per email is supported) and send the email to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:import-task@pts.bbconsult.co.uk">import-task@pts.bbconsult.co.uk</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="mailto:import-issue@pts.bbconsult.co.uk">import-issue@pts.bbconsult.co.uk</a>. The email should not contain anything apart from valid PTS commands.</p>
