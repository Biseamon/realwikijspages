<h1>Blueberry Group : What is the difference between Tasks, Issues and Tickets?&nbsp;</h1>
<p>Created by Jason Cozza on Aug 24, 2020</p>
<p>Items entered into PTS will be one of the following: Issue, Task or Ticket.</p>
<p>Tasks and issues are very similar in PTS - they have a lot of common features and are, essentially, the same thing inside the PTS database - but should be used in different situations as explained below:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Issues - Bugs and other problems that need to be fixed.<br><br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Tasks - Items of developer work that need to be completed, such as new features, etc. These are typically chargeable items and are linked to a plan of work within a Project.<br><br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Tickets - Are given to customers and non-Blueberry personnel so that they can track an issue or task that they have reported. When the issue or task has been completed, the ticket holder can be notified. Several tickets can correspond to a single task or issue.</li>
</ul>
