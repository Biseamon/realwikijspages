                    <h2 id="DeveloperTimesheets-SettingWorkingTime">Setting Working Time</h2><hr/><p>Your working time will allow managers and other developers to see when your are available. To set your working hours:</p><ol><li>Open the '<strong>My Details</strong>' menu.</li><li>Click '<strong>My Timesheets</strong>'.</li><li>Find the day that you are interested in.</li><li>Highlight the hours that you are available for on the timesheet.</li><li>Right click and click the ‘<strong>Mark selected as working time</strong>‘ button next to Planned Time.</li></ol><p>If you will be available for the same hours each day in a week, simply:</p><ol><li>Allocate the working hours for a single day.</li><li>Click the ‘<strong>Copy selected day</strong>‘ button.</li><li>Select the next day and click ‘<strong>Paste selected day</strong>‘.</li><li>Repeat for each day in that week</li></ol><p>When you have set your working time for each day in a week, you can then use it to create a template for your working hours that will automatically appear on your timesheet for each week. To do this:</p><ol><li>Complete the working hours for a single week.</li><li>Click the '<strong>Set current week as a template</strong>' button.<br/><br/></li></ol><p> </p><h2 id="DeveloperTimesheets-BookingTimeforWorkDone">Booking Time for Work Done</h2><hr/><p>To book time to work done on either a Task or an Issue, do the following:</p><ol><li>Open the '<strong>My Details</strong>' menu</li><li>Click '<strong>My Timesheets</strong>'.</li><li>Click the '<strong>Entity</strong>' button next to Timesheet Items.</li><li>Select 'Entity' from them 'Type ' drop down menu (this should be selected by default).</li><li>Enter the Task / Issue number in the 'Work Item' field.</li><li>Use the Start and End fields to enter the time that you spent working on that item.</li><li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li></ol><p>When the item is saved, you will see a block of time appear on the timesheet UI that represents the time spent working on that item.<br/><br/>Alternatively, the time spent can be added to the timesheet by dragging it from the list of tasks and issues that appear on the right side of the screen. The time booked will begin where the top left corner of the dragged item is placed. This can be changed by simply dragging the block of time around the timesheet. Similarly, the period of time that the work took can be changed by stretching the block of time. Double clicking on the block will open a popup window that will also allow you to edit the start and end time of the work done.<br/><br/>A final method to set the time for the work done is to highlight the correct time on the timesheet and then drag the task or issue onto the highlighted time - the block of time will automatically be set to the highlighted time.</p><p> </p><h2 id="DeveloperTimesheets-OtherTimesheetItems">Other Timesheet Items</h2><hr/><p>If you need to book time to something that is not either a task or an issue, the following items are also available:</p><ul><li>Paid Holiday - Permament employees can book paid holidays from their annual allocation of holidays days. For more details on holidays, go <a href="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/human-resources/remote-employees/holidays/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</li><li>Unwell - Use this if you have been unable to work because of illness. For more details on sick leave, go <a href="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/human-resources/remote-employees/illness-procedures/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</li><li>Other Discussion - Use this for work that is not part of a project to which you have been assigned. We should aim to track as much work against a project as possible.</li><li>Unpaid Leave - This should be used rarely and with agreement from your project manager. This is for marking time that you are planning not to work but aren't expecting to be treated as Paid Holiday.</li><li>No Work Assigned - This is expected to be used very rarely. This is used to indicate that you were not given work by your project manager. If you have less than 3 days work lined up ahead of you it is your responsibility to tell your manager that you are running out of work. Remind them each day until they find you some work. If you actually run out of work then you should mail the two managing directors Martin Green (<a class="external-link" href="mailto:martin.green@bbconsult.co.uk" rel="nofollow">martin.green@bbconsult.co.uk</a>) and David Lee (<a class="external-link" href="mailto:david.lee@blueberrysystems.co.uk" rel="nofollow">david.lee@blueberrysystems.co.uk</a>). If you don’t have work at the end of that day, then something has probably gone wrong with email. In that case, use Skype, phone, and any other method you can think of to get hold of a manager. As long as you follow that process then we’ll have no objections to paying you for time you spent waiting for new work to be assigned. We do expect you to try and make good use of that time, e.g. by studying existing code.</li></ul><p>All of these items are added by selecting the correct day and then clicking the relevant button at the top of the timesheet.<br/><br/>Alternatively, select the time on the timesheet, click the <strong>Entity</strong> button next to Timesheet Items and then select the type of item in the <strong>Type</strong> drop down menu.</p><p> </p><h2 id="DeveloperTimesheets-StateHolidays">State Holidays</h2><hr/><p>If a day is a state holiday that you are eligible for, the day will be highlighted in red and a set of additional buttons will appear at the top of the timesheet.</p><ul><li>Take selected holiday - you intend to take the holiday and not work</li><li>Reserve selected holiday- you intend to work on this day but will take another day as holiday instead</li><li>Take holiday as a work day - you intend to work on this day and want to be paid for it</li></ul><p>If you choose to reserve a holiday an additional option will become available:</p><ul><li>Take reserved holiday - you intend to take a holiday on this day instead of the usual state holiday<br/><br/></li></ul><h2 id="DeveloperTimesheets-CreatinganInvoice">Creating an Invoice</h2><hr/><p><strong>Important</strong>: Invoices should be created and sent for confirmation <strong>every calendar month</strong>. Invoices should be created at the end of last working day of month or on the first day of next month. <strong>Please note: </strong>You should invoice every calendar month, <strong>even if</strong> you've just started with Blueberry and worked only a few hours in the month.</p><p>To submit a invoice for payment, you first need to have items booked to your timesheet. You can then submit an invoice from the Invoices screen (<a class="external-link" href="http://pts.bbconsult.co.uk/EditBBEmployee.aspx?page=Invoices" rel="nofollow">http://pts.bbconsult.co.uk/EditBBEmployee.aspx?page=Invoices</a>) by doing the following:</p><ol><li>Open the '<strong>My Details</strong>'.</li><li>Click '<strong>Personal Details</strong>'.</li><li>Click '<strong>Invoices</strong>' in the menu on the right side of the screen</li><li>Click on the <strong>Create Invoice</strong> button - this will add a new invoice entry in the grid.<strong><br/></strong></li><li>Click on the <strong>Edit</strong> link for the new Invoice.</li><li>Select the correct <strong>Month</strong> that you wish to be paid for and then click <strong>Refresh Data. </strong>Note: it is necessary to select <strong>Month</strong> only for your first invoice. For rest of invoices you will need to <strong>Refresh Data </strong>only.</li><li>Add any Adjustments or Allowances as necessary (for example, equipment allowance or monthly internet allowance).</li><li>Click the <strong>Send Invoice</strong> button.</li></ol><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;">  or</p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;">  Click <strong>Close Details</strong> to return to the main Invoices screen and click the <strong>Send</strong> link next to the relevant Invoice (Note: Until the Send link is clicked, it is still possible to edit the invoice)</p><p>Please note, that page with invoices is also accessible via menu: My Details / My Invoices.</p><p>It is possible to delay payment for invoices. This feature can be used if you would like to get payments for several invoice at once. You can do this by setting 'Delay Payment' flag for invoice. You will get invoices paid, when you clear this flag.</p>
