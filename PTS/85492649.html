<p>Each developer is expected to work a certain amount of hours. The number of hours expected can vary from developer to developer so this value is specified for each developer on their Billing Details page in PTS. If the developers working mode is set to ‘Full Time’, the working hours will always be set to 40 hours and the box cannot be edited to change this. However, if the the developer is ‘Part Time’, the working hours box can be edited to manually set how many hours they are expected to work.<br><br>&nbsp;</p>

<p><br>However, rather than rigidly forcing a developer to work those exact hours each week, they are allowed be flexible with their working hours. For example, if they work a few extra hours this week, they can work a few weeks less next week and vice versa.<br><br>To ensure that a developer is not consistently working too few or too many hours tracks, PTS tracks that developer's 'Hours owed' - this is the difference between their expected working hours and the number of hours booked on their timesheets. A positive figure means the developer needs to do a bit more work, whilst a negative figure means the developer has worked a bit too much.<br><br>The Hours owed is tracked on a rolling 4 week basis with the developer's manager receiving an email if the value becomes too high in either direction.<br><br>&nbsp;</p>

<p><br>The example above shows that the developer owed 20 hours from before the start of the current 4 week window but then worked 130 hours more than expected during the 4 weeks. As a result he is now owed 110 hours.<br><br>If a manager receives one of these emails, they should check that the developer is not working too many or too few hours. If the manager is satisfied with the situation (if the hours are as a result of an error in PTS, for example), they can simply reset the developer's owed hours by editing the Hours owed field in PTS and replacing the current value with 0.<br><br>The manager who will receive the email is determined by the developers Main Project setting which is specified on their Working Items page on PTS. The manager of their Main Project will be inherited as their manager. If no Main Project is set for any reason, the Developer's Manager field is used instead to manually choose a manager (Note - if a Main Project has been selected, the Developer's Manager field is disabled)</p>
