                    <p>Items entered into PTS will be one of the following:</p><ul><li>Issues – Bugs and other problems that need to be fixed.</li><li><span>Tasks – Items of developer work that need to be completed, such as new features, etc. These are typically chargeable items linked to work that is planned in a Project.</span></li><li><span>Tickets – Are given to customers and non-Blueberry personnel so that they can track an issue or task that they have reported. When the issue or task has been completed, the ticket holder can be notified. Several tickets can correspond to a single task or issue.</span></li></ul><p>If you select any of these options from the menu bar, you will be given the option of viewing all of the current or to open a new issue / task / ticket.<br/><br/>Whenever one of these items are modified or changing, all members of the issue team will be sent an email informing them of what changes have been made.</p><h2 id="Tasks,IssuesandTickets-Viewing">Viewing</h2><hr/><p>When 'All...' is selected from the relevant menu, you will be given a table with all of existing entries in it. The list of items can be narrowed down by opening the <strong>Show Filters</strong> panel to quickly assign filters. Alternatively, you can type something into the <strong>search text</strong> field and narrow the list by keywords.</p><p><br/>Any item of interest can be opened by clicking on either its number or title.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if you already know the item number for a task or issue that you want to view, you can type the item number into the PTS search box.</p><h2 id="Tasks,IssuesandTickets-AddingaTask,IssueOrTicket">Adding a Task, Issue Or Ticket</h2><hr/><p>When creating a new issue / task / ticket, simply enter all of the relevant details and then select the <strong>Update Issue/Task/Ticket</strong> button.<br/><br/>If you wish to add an attachment, this cannot be done until the item has already been saved and allocated a number. Once the item has been saved for the first time (as above), simply add the attachment and click the <strong>Update Issue/Task/Ticket</strong> button again.<br/><br/>There are a number of fields that can be filled in but the most commonly used ones are:</p><ul><li>Task - the parent task that this item me need to be attached to.</li><li><span>Subject - a very brief summary of the item.</span></li><li><span>Description - a more detailed explanation of the item with the option to include rich text.</span></li><li><span>Attachments - any files that may be associated with the item (Note - attachments cannot be added until the issue has been created).</span></li><li><span>Issue Team - everyone in the list will be emailed whenever the item is updated (add memebrs by selecting them from the drop down menu and then pressing the add button).</span></li><li><span>Priority - an indication of how urgently the item needs looking at. Unless a manager says otherwise, tasks and issues should be worked on in priority order - Urgent tasks / issues first, then High, then Normal and Low tasks/ issues last.</span></li><li><span>Status - an indication as to who currently needs to be looking at the item.</span><br/><span><br/></span></li></ul><p>Once all necessary fields have been completed, click 'Update Issue/Task/Ticket' to save.<br/><br/>If the task or issue is successfully saved, all members of the team will receive a summary email.</p><p><br/></p><h2 id="Tasks,IssuesandTickets-Task/IssueStatus">Task/Issue Status</h2><hr/><p><br/></p><p>A Task or Issue can have one of many statuses as follows:</p><div class="table-wrap"><table class="confluenceTable"><colgroup><col/><col/><col/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><strong>Status</strong></td><td class="confluenceTd"><strong>Meaning</strong></td><td class="confluenceTd"><strong>When you should set this status</strong></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd">Waiting for Developer Team(WfDT)</td><td class="confluenceTd">A manager has assigned the task / issue to the developer team to complete.

Generally only managers and testers will close tasks or issues.</li></ul><h2 id="Tasks,IssuesandTickets-MyWorkingItems">My Working Items</h2><hr/><p>Any task / issue that are currently assigned to you will appear on the <a class="external-link" href="http://pts.bbconsult.co.uk/UserTasks.aspx" rel="nofollow">My Working Items screen</a><br/><br/>The items displayed can be filtered by Status.<br/><br/>Generally speaking, assigned items should be completed in priority order - Urgent items first, then High, Normal, and Low last. Of course, if a manager asks for items to be completed in a different order then they should be completed in the order that he/she specifies.</p><h2 id="Tasks,IssuesandTickets-Estimates">Estimates</h2><hr/><p>One of the big problems with remote work is that it can be quite easy for people to be confused about the size of a task and progress within it. A project manager might ask for an item of work that he thinks will take a week’s effort and the developer might think it will take three weeks.<br/><br/>Sometimes the reason will be that the project manager isn’t aware of a technical difficulty. Sometimes the developer will not be aware that there’s some existing work that can be copied. Sometimes the developer and the project manager will have entirely different ideas about what the client wants to see.<br/><br/>The worst time to find out about the differences of opinion is when the project manager asks “Why has this taken twice as long as I expect?” It is particularly bad if it turns out the answer is “Half of what’s been implemented isn’t wanted by the client”.<br/><br/>To avoid that situation we encourage developers to do two things:<br/><span> </span></p><ul><li><span>Add a PTS estimate for each task, or issue, that looks like it might take more than a few hours.</span></li><li><span> </span> <span>If a task is expected to take more than 3 days, then break it down into smaller tasks that are not expected to take more than 3 days.</span></li><li><span> </span> <span>Most task descriptions should be something that one of our testers can read and say “yes, that’s complete” or “no, that’s incomplete”. It’s absolutely permissible to do that by referencing a design document.</span></li></ul><p><br/>By doing that, it becomes much easier for a project manager to spot a potential problem early and save developers from unnecessary work.</p><h2 id="Tasks,IssuesandTickets-UpdatingaTask,IssueOrTicket">Updating a Task, Issue Or Ticket</h2><hr/><p>Updating a task or issue is done in exactly the same way as when a task or issue is added. To start editing, just find the relevant task or issue on the All Tasks / All Issue screens and then click on it to open it for editing. When editing is complete, click <strong>Update Task</strong> / <strong>Update Issue</strong>.<br/><br/>Alternatively, when a commit is made to SVN, by entering the working item number in SVN, the relevant Task or Issue will automatically be updated in PTS - a comment will be added and the status will be updated to '<strong>Waiting for release to testers</strong>'.<br/><br/>When changes to a task or issue are saved, all members of the team will receive a summary email, indicating what the changes are.</p><h2 id="Tasks,IssuesandTickets-UpdatingaTaskorIssuebyE-mail">Updating a Task or Issue by E-mail</h2><hr/><p>Instead of using the PTS web app to create and edit tasks/issues/issues, you can simply send and email with special tags at the end instead. This is useful if someone reports an issue or task to you by email and you quickly want to open a task/issue in PTS.<br/><br/>To find the correct email address to send the email to you first need to know the short code for the project. Then you need to decide if you want to open an issue, task or ticket and then. Once you have these two pieces of information, the email is formed as follows:</p><p class="rteindent3"><em>&lt;task/issue/ticket&gt;</em>-<em>&lt;customer short name&gt;-&lt;project short code&gt;</em>@<a class="external-link" href="http://pts.bbconsult.co.uk" rel="nofollow">pts.bbconsult.co.uk</a></p><p><br/>When the email is sent, the subject of the email will be used as the Subject in PTS and the body of the email will be used as the item Description. All other fields need to be configured using ## tags at the end of your email.<br/><br/>For example a task for the PTS project that is low priority and is waiting for a developer to look at it would appear as follows:<br/><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper"><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" confluence-query-params="effects=drop-shadow" src="attachments/85492602/85492603.png?effects=drop-shadow" data-image-src="attachments/85492602/85492603.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="85492603" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="ptsemail.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="85492602" data-linked-resource-container-version="1"></span></span><br/>The tags that need to be used will depend on whether your are updating a Task, Issue or Ticket. The tags for each type of item can be found on the pages below:</p><ul><li><a class="external-link" href="http://pts.bbconsult.co.uk/HelpTask.aspx" rel="nofollow">Task Tags</a></li><li><a class="external-link" href="http://pts.bbconsult.co.uk/HelpIssue.aspx" rel="nofollow">Issue Tags</a></li><li><a class="external-link" href="http://pts.bbconsult.co.uk/HelpTicket.aspx" rel="nofollow">Ticket Tags</a></li></ul><p>Alternatively, to record email conversations about a task or issue, add your <a class="external-link" href="mailto:developer.name-at-bbconsult.co.uk@pts.bbconsult.co.uk" rel="nofollow">developer.name-at-bbconsult.co.uk@pts.bbconsult.co.uk</a> email address as a recipient and start the title with 'Issue xxxxx'. The text in your email will then be added to the issue number used in the title.</p><p> </p>
