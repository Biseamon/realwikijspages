<h1>Managing Work Items&nbsp;</h1>
<p>PTS has a 'My Working Items' page, which displays a list of items that are assigned to the developer. This page includes tasks, issues and tickets.<br><br>By default, items are sorted in the following order:</p>
<ul>
  <li>By priority - items with Urgent and High priority go first</li>
  <li>By type - tasks go first, then issues and tickets</li>
  <li>By name</li>
</ul>
<p>However, project managers can override this ordering and make specific tasks/issues appear at the top of the list.</p>
<h2>Manage Working Items</h2>
<p>The page to manage working items is quite simple and looks like this:<br>&nbsp;</p>

<p><br>Developers will see items assigned to them in the same order as their manager does. If their manager would like to change the order, he can do this using the arrows on the right hand side. When the order has been correctly set, the manager needs to click the 'Save &amp; Notify' button to save the sorted order and to send a notice to the developer. The 'Clear Sort Order' button will clear the sorted order and return the list to the default order.<br><br>Note: the sorted order will be set for all visible items.<br><br>By default, only active and scheduled items are shown. In other words, only tasks and issues that have their status set to 'Active' and 'Waiting for Development Team'.<br><br>If necessary, it is possible to filter items by project and include items with other statuses, such as 'Waiting for Release to Test', Waiting for Testing', etc...<br>The filter look like this:<br>&nbsp;</p>
