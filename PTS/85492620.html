<h1>What is the difference between Tasks, Issues and Tickets?&nbsp;</h1>
<p>Items entered into PTS will be one of the following: Issue, Task or Ticket.</p>
<p>Tasks and issues are very similar in PTS - they have a lot of common features and are, essentially, the same thing inside the PTS database - but should be used in different situations as explained below:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Issues - Bugs and other problems that need to be fixed.<br><br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Tasks - Items of developer work that need to be completed, such as new features, etc. These are typically chargeable items and are linked to a plan of work within a Project.<br><br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Tickets - Are given to customers and non-Blueberry personnel so that they can track an issue or task that they have reported. When the issue or task has been completed, the ticket holder can be notified. Several tickets can correspond to a single task or issue.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Can I book time to an Enquiry?&nbsp;</h1>

<h1>What is included in the Customer Portal?&nbsp;</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This feature allows customers to log in and review the status of their project - they login through the same URL as BB employees (<a href="http://pts.bbconsult.co.uk">pts.bbconsult.co.uk</a>)<br><br>Customers will have specific permissions set that allow them limited access to PTS - these can be customised as necessary to give more or less access on a customer by customer basis.<br><br>Features that the customer does not have access to will simply be hidden from them.</p>

<h1>How do I use Excel to Import and Export Tasks?&nbsp;</h1>
<p>PTS allows the tasks for a project to be imported for and exported to .xls files.</p>
<h2>XLS File Creation</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Download the task xls template file from&nbsp; <a href="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/download/attachments/1507467/task-import-template.xls?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1453396055570&amp;api=v2">here</a>.</p>
<p>TODO: Locate Download</p>
<ol>
  <li>Enter the project name and code where indicated by 'xxxxx' and enter the project shortcode as the worksheet name (also indicated by 'xxxxx')</li>
  <li>Leave the Task ID column blank - this will allow the new tasks to be allocated a task number during the upload process</li>
  <li>Use the Level 1 - 5 columns to create the tree structure using the names of each task</li>
  <li>Enter any additional information into the other columns provided. Please note - where a reference to an employee is required (Responsible, Team, etc), enter their Short Name</li>
</ol>
<p>TODO: Locate Movie</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Uploading the XLS File</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To upload the tasks in PTS:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Login to PTS</li>
  <li>Go to the All Tasks page for the appropriate project</li>
  <li>Click the 'Import' button</li>
  <li>Select the xls file</li>
  <li>Click the 'Send Stats Report' checkbox - this will notify you when the upload is complete and of any errors that have occurred during upload.</li>
  <li>Click OK</li>
</ol>
<p>Alternatively, to upload the tasks by email attach the xls to an email (note - only one attachment per email is supported) and send the email to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:import-task@pts.bbconsult.co.uk">import-task@pts.bbconsult.co.uk</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="mailto:import-issue@pts.bbconsult.co.uk">import-issue@pts.bbconsult.co.uk</a>. The email should not contain anything apart from valid PTS commands.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>What reports are available from PTS?&nbsp;</h1>
<p>PTS contains a number of different reports. These are detailed below.</p>
<h2>Project Task Progress</h2>
<p>This report allows you to view the tasks (and optionally the Issues too) for a Project. The time spent on each task can be compared to the estimated time. Tasks are sorted by parent tasks, child tasks and issues (moving from left to right across the first 3 columns). Tasks can also be grouped by Scheduled. An overall summary is given at the bottom of the report.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/report1-1024x467.jpg"></figure>
<p>TODO: Locate Movie</p>
<h2>Task Reports</h2>
<p><a href="http://pts.bbconsult.co.uk/TaskList.aspx"><strong>Estimates Report</strong></a><br>Creates an Excel report in one of 3 formats – ‘Show Issues in Detail with Total Row’, ‘Show Issues Summarized’ and ‘Show Just Task Totals – No Issues’. Each report includes the time spent on each task or item and the estimated time, as well as the Status of each task. Tasks can be filtered by Status if desired.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/report2-1024x353.jpg"></figure>
<p><br>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://pts.bbconsult.co.uk/TaskList.aspx"><strong>Tasks Report</strong></a><br>Creates an Excel sheet that details all tasks for a project. A very simple report that just displays the contents of all selected fields (customisable when running the report) for each task.<br><br>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/report3-1024x300.jpg"></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TODO: Locate Movie</p>
<h2>Timesheet Reports</h2>
<p><a href="http://pts.bbconsult.co.uk/TimesheetList.aspx"><strong>Timesheets</strong></a><br>Displays the timesheets for all employees over a 4 weeks period.<br><br>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/report4.jpg"></figure>
<p><br>By clicking on a date, a more detailed view of that week can be seen in one of 3 views – simple view (See below), calendar view or detailed view.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/download/attachments/85492638/report5.png?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1598281856197&amp;api=v2&amp;effects=drop-shadow"></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br><a href="http://pts.bbconsult.co.uk/TimesheetListByProject.aspx"><strong>Timesheets By Projects</strong></a><br>Shows the hours spent by employees who have booked time against any project against all of the projects that have time booked to them for any set period of time along with their total time spent during that period.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/download/attachments/85492638/report6.png?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1598281856233&amp;api=v2&amp;effects=drop-shadow"></figure>
<p><br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br><a href="http://pts.bbconsult.co.uk/WeeklyTimesheetListByProject.aspx"><strong>Weekly Timesheets By Project</strong></a><br>Similar to the Timesheets report but breaks down the hours spent into weeks on a per project basis.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/download/attachments/85492638/report7.png?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1598281856250&amp;api=v2&amp;effects=drop-shadow"></figure>
<p><br>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Revenue Report</h2>
<p><br>Displays revenue by month for each project over a set period of time, as well as the total revenue for that same period. Columns are colour coded to indicate past months, current months and future months. Can be run for Projects or Enquiries.<br>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>How can a Manager change a Developer's working hours?&nbsp;</h1>
<p>A developer's expected working hours and working mode (ie full time or part time), are set on their employee page in PTS under the 'Billing Details' tab.<br><br>If the developers working mode is set to 'Full Time', the working hours will always be set to 40 hours and the box cannot be edited to change this.<br><br>However, if the the developer is 'Part Time', the working hours box can be edited to manually set how many hours they are expected to work.</p>
<h1>How can a Manager change a Developer's time owed?&nbsp;</h1>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/download/attachments/85492649/owedhrs.png?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1598282084623&amp;api=v2&amp;effects=drop-shadow"></figure>
<p>Each developer is expected to work a certain amount of hours. The number of hours expected can vary from developer to developer so this value is specified for each developer on their Billing Details page in PTS. If the developers working mode is set to ‘Full Time’, the working hours will always be set to 40 hours and the box cannot be edited to change this. However, if the the developer is ‘Part Time’, the working hours box can be edited to manually set how many hours they are expected to work.<br><br>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/download/attachments/85492649/expecthrs.png?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1598282084653&amp;api=v2&amp;effects=drop-shadow"></figure>
<p><br>However, rather than rigidly forcing a developer to work those exact hours each week, they are allowed be flexible with their working hours. For example, if they work a few extra hours this week, they can work a few weeks less next week and vice versa.<br><br>To ensure that a developer is not consistently working too few or too many hours tracks, PTS tracks that developer's 'Hours owed' - this is the difference between their expected working hours and the number of hours booked on their timesheets. A positive figure means the developer needs to do a bit more work, whilst a negative figure means the developer has worked a bit too much.<br><br>The Hours owed is tracked on a rolling 4 week basis with the developer's manager receiving an email if the value becomes too high in either direction.<br><br>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/download/attachments/85492649/timeworked.jpg?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1598282084663&amp;api=v2&amp;effects=drop-shadow"></figure>
<p><br>The example above shows that the developer owed 20 hours from before the start of the current 4 week window but then worked 130 hours more than expected during the 4 weeks. As a result he is now owed 110 hours.<br><br>If a manager receives one of these emails, they should check that the developer is not working too many or too few hours. If the manager is satisfied with the situation (if the hours are as a result of an error in PTS, for example), they can simply reset the developer's owed hours by editing the Hours owed field in PTS and replacing the current value with 0.<br><br>The manager who will receive the email is determined by the developers Main Project setting which is specified on their Working Items page on PTS. The manager of their Main Project will be inherited as their manager. If no Main Project is set for any reason, the Developer's Manager field is used instead to manually choose a manager (Note - if a Main Project has been selected, the Developer's Manager field is disabled)<br>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Where can I find the test sub-system&nbsp;</h1>
<p>This feature is used to setup test plans and allows testers to record how the system performs against the tests.<br><br>There is currently a&nbsp;<a href="http://tests.pts.bbconsult.co.uk/test/screens/Login.html">prototype available</a>&nbsp;and a version on the&nbsp;<a href="http://pts-test.bbconsult.co.uk/TestingMetafileList.aspx">PTS test site</a>.<br><br>LDAP details are required to log onto the test site and it should be noted that, at the moment, there is no page to add/edit session details.</p>
