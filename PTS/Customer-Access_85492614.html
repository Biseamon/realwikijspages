<h1>Customer Access&nbsp;</h1>
<p>Some times it may be helpful to give a customer limited to access to PTS - this would generally be so that they can get visibility of outstanding tickets / issues or something similar. This achieved by assign roles to the user to grant them the appropriate permissions in PTS.<br><br>There are currently several roles that could potentially be assigned to a customer user:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Simple Customer</strong>: The most basic role - the user can simply log in and view / edit tickets</li>
  <li><strong>Customer Portal</strong>: The standard role for a customer - when logged in, the user sees the customer portal, which includes various details of the project. The user can also view tasks / issues, contact the PM and receive notification emails</li>
  <li><strong>Extended Customer</strong>: The most advanced role - the user can view / edit tickets, issues and tasks, as well as being able to contact the PM</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also a couple of slightly more specific support user roles available:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Customer Support User</strong>: The user receives acknowledgement and updates emails and can edit tickets</li>
  <li><strong>Hubbell Support User</strong>: Similar to the standard Customer Support Role but the user also receives response from PTS and is automatically added to project teams</li>
</ul>
<p>To give a customer a role:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Go to Admin -&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Manage Users</strong></li>
  <li>Either add a new user or search for an existing user</li>
  <li>Click&nbsp;<strong>edit</strong></li>
  <li>Go to the&nbsp;<strong>Groups, Roles and Permissions tab</strong>&nbsp;(if a new user was created, set a password on the Basic Details tab first and click Save)</li>
  <li>Select the relevant role in the&nbsp;<strong>Roles Added To This User</strong>&nbsp;drop down and click&nbsp;<strong>Add</strong><br><strong>Note</strong>&nbsp;- if a suitable role is not available, contact&nbsp;<a href="mailto:oliver.goodman@bbconsult.co.uk">Oliver Goodman</a>&nbsp;and he will create a new role that is suitable for the user.</li>
  <li>Click&nbsp;<strong>Save</strong></li>
</ol>
