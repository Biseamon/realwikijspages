                    <p>Some times it may be helpful to give a customer limited to access to PTS - this would generally be so that they can get visibility of outstanding tickets / issues or something similar. This achieved by assign roles to the user to grant them the appropriate permissions in PTS.<br/><br/>There are currently several roles that could potentially be assigned to a customer user:</p><ul><li><strong>Simple Customer</strong>: The most basic role - the user can simply log in and view / edit tickets</li><li><strong>Customer Portal</strong><span>: The standard role for a customer - when logged in, the user sees the customer portal, which includes various details of the project. The user can also view tasks / issues, contact the PM and receive notification emails</span></li><li><strong>Extended Customer</strong><span>: The most advanced role - the user can view / edit tickets, issues and tasks, as well as being able to contact the PM</span></li></ul><p>There are also a couple of slightly more specific support user roles available:</p><ul><li><strong>Customer Support User</strong>: The user receives acknowledgement and updates emails and can edit tickets</li><li><strong>Hubbell Support User</strong><span>: Similar to the standard Customer Support Role but the user also receives response from PTS and is automatically added to project teams</span></li></ul><p>To give a customer a role:</p><ol><li>Go to Admin -&gt; <strong>Manage Users</strong></li><li><span>Either add a new user or search for an existing user</span></li><li>Click <strong>edit</strong></li><li>Go to the <strong>Groups, Roles and Permissions tab</strong> (if a new user was created, set a password on the Basic Details tab first and click Save)</li><li>Select the relevant role in the <strong>Roles Added To This User</strong> drop down and click <strong>Add</strong><br/><strong>Note</strong> - if a suitable role is not available, contact <a class="external-link" href="mailto:oliver.goodman@bbconsult.co.uk" rel="nofollow">Oliver Goodman</a> and he will create a new role that is suitable for the user.</li><li>Click <strong>Save</strong></li></ol><p> </p>
