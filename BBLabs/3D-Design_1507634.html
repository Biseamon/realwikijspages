<br/>
The aim of this project was to design, manufacture and test a bespoke lock enclosure can could be controlled over the Internet. An analysis of the available manufacturing processes was performed and as a result, three main techniques were chosen: <strong>3D printing</strong>, <strong>resin casting</strong>, <strong>laser-cutting</strong> and <strong>CNC machining</strong>.<br/>
<br/>
Testing revealed that 3D printing was the easiest manufacturing method, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">laser-cutting was the fastest and most inexpensive</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">CNC machining the most accurate and produced higher quality components</span>. In order for the end user to have the freedom of choice , the lock design was tailored to allow manufacturing using any of the methods mentioned above. This allows the user to make a decision based on time, accuracy and budget. Another step towards creating a versatile design was to keep the internal electronics identical for all the versions of the enclosure (only the length of the wires varies slightly).<br/>
<h2 id="id-3DDesign-Introduction">Introduction</h2><br/>
<br/>
<hr/><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The main focus of the project was to create a lock that is innovative, inexpensive, fun to build but has the same structural integrity as a commercial lock. Depending on the preffered programming language, 2 versions of the lock's internal electronics have been created for Javascript or C/C++ programmers.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<h3 id="id-3DDesign-Software">Software</h3><br/>
- The software used for the design work was Catia V5, the Part and Product workbenches;<br/>
<br/>
- WinPC NC Pro: Software that controls the CNC machine and loads NC files to send to the machine;<br/>
<br/>
- MeshCAM: used to create toolpaths (NC files) from the CAD files. We have tried FeatureCAM as well, which is more powereful than MeshCAM but lacks the post-processor to make the code readable by WinPC;<br/>
<br/>
- CutViewer Mill: used to view the toolpaths and check for errors before actually starting to cut;<br/>
<br/>
- LaserWorks: software used to communicate with the laser cutter, load DXF files and prepare the settings at which the cutting takes place.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<h3 id="id-3DDesign-Apparatus">Apparatus</h3><br/>
The CNC machine of choice was a 3-axis <strong>Heiz S400-T</strong> equiped with a Kress 1050 spindle and a Zero3 controller.<br/>

<h2 id="id-3DDesign-OperatingPrinciple">Operating Principle</h2><br/>
<br/>
<hr/><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The lock was designed on a simple, yet robust principle. In the picture below you can see one of the final iterations having the electronic components test fitted.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/1.png" rel="nofollow"><img alt="1" class="aligncenter wp-image-2901" height="370" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/06/1-1024x440.png" width="860"/></a><br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Looking at the picture below makes the operating principle easier to understand.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Explanation1.png" rel="nofollow"><img alt="Explanation" class="aligncenter wp-image-2937" height="484" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Explanation1.png" width="860"/></a><br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
As the motor spins, the 3D printed hook moves and with it the metal bolt, thus opening or closing the lock. The hook moves due to two nuts fixed on the sides. Because the hook is sitting in a groove that keeps the nuts from spinning, they have no choice but to move up or down the rod. The advantage of this mechanism is the direct contact between the motor and hook, which ensures that all the torque is transmitted constantly (no slip) to the bolt, practically transforming the rod into a lead-screw.<br/>
<br/>
When the hook comes close to either of the QRD sensors, they send a  signal to the micro controller, which in turn stops the motor and displays a message on the web interface: 'The lock is closed' (or open).<br/>
<br/>
The system works as long as the bolt is placed on the hook. Should the user decide to operate the bolt manually and forget to place it back on the hook, the whole system is rendered useless. To overcome this problem, a contact was formed between the two pieces of Velcro (picture above) using the bolt itself. The larger piece of Velcro on the LHS is connected to a digital pin of the Pico an the Velcro on the RHS is connected to a GND pin. When the contact is made via the bolt, the output reads '1', meaning the bolt is placed on the hook. The contact between the bolt and Velcro connected to the digital pin is made via a smaller piece of Velcro placed in the hook. As the bolt moves, the Velcro in the hook brushes against the Velcro connected to the digital pin and thus ensuring a contact is constantly present. The advantage of this design is that it eliminates the need for moving wires, which are prone to breaking. Also, since the bolt is not connected to a power pin, there is no risk of producing a short circuit or suffering an electric shock.<br/>
<br/>
The micro controller can be powered using a USB plug or by connecting the power pins to a battery pack. We recommend a 6V battery pack to ensure the motor is spinning fast enough, but this can go up to 9V with no problems excepting the increased noise.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<h2 id="id-3DDesign-Prototyping">Prototyping</h2><br/>
<br/>
<hr/><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As mentioned previously, we have been experimenting creating the lock utilising some modern micro manufacturing methods. After a lot of testing and tweaking the design, only two methods were deemed viable: laser cutting and CNC machining. Find below the pros and cons of each method.<br/>
<h3 id="id-3DDesign-1.3DPrinting">1. 3D Printing</h3><br/>
Since we had some experience using desktop <a href="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/bb-labs/3d-printers/" rel="nofollow">3D printers</a>, we were able to quickly make prototypes and assess their potential to become a finished product. A short demonstration of an initial prototype can be seen below. Please note that the initial design you see has been changed but the operating principle remains the same. This prototype was made using an <a class="external-link" href="https://ultimaker.com/" rel="nofollow">Ultimaker </a>(original) on custom settings and 20% infill.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
One of the most common problem we have encountered with FDM (Fused Depositing Modelling) printers is that components with a large base area are prone to have the corners detach (lift) from the build platform. Having a heated build platform does help to some extent but never solves the problem completely.<br/>

<br/>
Tests performed on a <a class="external-link" href="http://pp3dp.com/" rel="nofollow">Up! Plus 2</a> or a <a class="external-link" href="http://www.cel-robox.com/" rel="nofollow">CEL Robox</a>  had less lift around the edges, but still to a noticeable degree.The issue we were having with these two printers was the small print beds. A full lock could not be printed so it has been sliced in half and connected together like Lego. A useful property of ABS plastic is that it can be cured with Acetone to remove any imperfections and leaves the part with a glossy surface.<br/>
<br/>
Please note that this version is different from the latest one as this was design to accommodate an Espruino controller and not the new Pico version.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Better results will be obtained with professional printers. Sites like <a class="external-link" href="http://www.shapeways.com/" rel="nofollow">Shapeways</a>, <a class="external-link" href="https://www.3dprint-uk.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">3DPRINTUK </a>or <a class="external-link" href="http://www.sculpteo.com/en/" rel="nofollow">Sculpteo </a>can provide quality components, but the price for this application would have been quite high.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<h3 id="id-3DDesign-2.ResinCasting">2. Resin Casting</h3><br/>
This method involves considerably more work than simply sending an STL file to print. This is a 3-part process which takes more than a day to complete. The steps are described below:<br/>
<h4 id="id-3DDesign-2.1Createapositivemold">2.1 Create a positive mold</h4><br/>
This step involved creating a positive mold from a <a class="external-link" href="http://www.easycomposites.co.uk/products/tooling-modelling-board/pu-high-density-model-board.aspx" rel="nofollow">high density foam</a> using the CNC machine for maximum accuracy. This process can take up to 3-4 hours for a high surface finish.<br/>

After the CNC job was done, we simply placed some cardboard in the out-most groove and filled the mold up with RTV rubber. Often, the rubber is left to cure overnight before it gets peeled out of the high density foam. The initial batch of molds was made using inexpensive <a class="external-link" href="http://www.mbfg.co.uk/rtv-silicone/gp-3481-f.html" rel="nofollow">RTV Silicone Rubber</a>. The initial results were promising, but due to the flexible nature of the rubber, the components often had dimensional inaccuracies compared to the CAD model.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The rubber captured all the details quite nicely. To obtain a smooth surface finish as above, the rubber was degassed before being poured into the mold. The degassing setup (picture below) consist of a vacuum pump and a vacuum chamber. After mixing the rubber, it was placed inside the chamber and the vacuum pump extracts most air bubbles, resulting in a thick, smooth mixture to create the mold.<br/>

Wanting to improve the quality of the molds, we have started to look for addition cure silicone rubbers and found <a class="external-link" href="https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CCIQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fresources.renishaw.com%2Fen%2Fdownload%2F(0f4bcf38972240809eef0dbde325842d)&amp;ei=QbWfVeORIqOM7Abp44jACA&amp;usg=AFQjCNEX7qPiMU_47CWqIqC9JZH0MCWS1w&amp;sig2=1rdaJwvaE66I8GrOyI2JCQ&amp;bvm=bv.96952980,d.ZGU" rel="nofollow">VTV 750</a>. Higher viscosity and shore hardness makes it more suitable for this application. It is also less expensive (£67.50 compared to £80 for RTV) and has a longer pot life.<br/>
<br/>

Although it is just as good at capturing fine details, and considerably stiffer than general purpose RTV, it's surface is slightly rough and some micro air bubbles can be present even after degassing. Through testing we have found limitations which allowed us to adjust the CAD model to increase it's performance.<br/>

<h4 id="id-3DDesign-2.3Castingthepart">2.3 Casting the part</h4><br/>
Some 24 hours after starting the process, we are able to start producing components. Preparing the resin is similar to preparing the silicone rubber for the mold:<br/>
<br/>
- Mix the 2-part resin (we have used <a class="external-link" href="http://www.mbfg.co.uk/polyurethane-casting-resin/easyflo_60.html" rel="nofollow">Polytek Easy Flow 60</a> and <a class="external-link" href="http://www.innovative-polymers.com/images/specs/Classic-Shore-D/IE-3075.pdf" rel="nofollow">IE-3075</a>)<br/>
<br/>
- Degas the mix in the vacuum chamber<br/>
<br/>
- Pour the mix in the rubber mold and leave it to cool down<br/>
<br/>
In an attempt to obtain a smooth finish on both sides of the part, a rubber lid was made to fit inside the mold. The lid had holes drilled in it to allow for excess resin to slow out.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We have also experiented with pigments to give the components a different look.<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
After months of testing we decided not to pursue this route as components constantly developed air bubbles on the backside. We have tried different pouring techniques (injecting the resin using a syringe, pouring on a thin flow, etc.) but never could fully eliminate this defect. It seems a limitation of the rubber molds.<br/>
<br/>

Having molds made out of Aluminium or Steel would most likely result in a finished product, but the manufacturing costs are unjustified at this stage.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<h3 id="id-3DDesign-3.LaserCutting">3. Laser Cutting</h3><br/>
This method involved a complete redesign of the lock case. The 3D model was sliced into 10 layers of 3mm thickness.We have tested both plywood and Acrylic as they are common, inexpensive materials known to produce quality results under laser cutting.<br/>
<br/>

For the physical build, we have chosen to laser-cut 3mm plywood. To do this, the CAD model was used to create a DXF file with all the layers laid down on a 600mm x 300mm sheet. This method was by far the fastest and most inexpensive, as the material was approximately £4 and takes approximately 20 minutes to cut out on a Class IV laser (add £20 for booking the machine for an hour).<br/>

At first there were some concerns about structural resistance of this design as only the top 2 layers actually take the load when the lock is in operation. A quick test having a 90kg person standing directly on top of it (all the force is applied on the bolt) revealed that it is actually quite resistant. Also, because the design is modular, the user can simply increase the number of top layers without having to change anything (except longer screws, of course).<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
It was mentioned that this layer design works with plywood and Acrylic, but it can be made out of any sheet material which is 3mm thick. Also, the laser cutter was preferred for its speed and contribution to the learning curve but it can be easily cut using a CNC machine. Again, this is entirely the user's choice.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<h3 id="id-3DDesign-4.CNCMachining">4. CNC Machining</h3><br/>
We were impressed by the accuracy of the CNC but the silicone rubber molds had their limitations. As such, we have decided to use the CNC to create the actual lock. The material selection is quite broad, ranging from wood to Aluminium or Acrylic. We have experimented using English Oak as it is quite hard, affordable and easy to mill.<br/>

This design was changes slightly compared to the initial 3D printed one in order to accommodate the latest micro controllers.<br/>

The result of an initial test is displayed below. The total time including manual tool changing was approximately 3 hours per hlaf.<br/>

The surface finish is impressive. The only extra finishing method would be staining the wood, coating it or anything the user decides fitting.<br/>

<h2 id="id-3DDesign-Conclusions">Conclusions</h2><br/>
This project had a steep learning curve but it allowed us to explore some manufacturing areas that coupled with our knowledge of software lead to the creation of a finished product that started as nothing more than an idea on a blank piece of paper. We have learned the advantages and limitations of each manufacturing method and were able to critically appraise them in order to focus on the ones with the most potential of becoming a reality.<br/>
