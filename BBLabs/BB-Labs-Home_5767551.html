<h1>3D Design&nbsp;</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p><br><br><br>The aim of this project was to design, manufacture and test a bespoke lock enclosure can could be controlled over the Internet. An analysis of the available manufacturing processes was performed and as a result, three main techniques were chosen: <strong>3D printing</strong>, <strong>resin casting</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>laser-cutting</strong> and <strong>CNC machining</strong>.<br><br>Testing&nbsp;revealed that 3D printing was the easiest manufacturing method, <u>laser-cutting was the fastest and most inexpensive</u> and <u>CNC machining the most accurate and produced higher quality components</u>. In order for the end user to have the freedom of choice , the lock design was tailored to allow manufacturing using any of the methods mentioned above. This allows the user to make a decision based on time, accuracy and budget. Another step towards creating a versatile design was to keep the internal electronics identical for all the versions of the enclosure (only the length of the wires varies slightly).<br>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The main focus of the project was to create a lock that is innovative, inexpensive, fun to build but has the same structural integrity as a commercial lock. Depending on the preffered programming language, 2 versions of the lock's internal electronics have been created for Javascript or C/C++ programmers.<br><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p><br>- The software used for the design work was Catia V5, the Part and Product workbenches;<br><br>- WinPC NC Pro: Software that controls the CNC machine and loads NC files to send to the machine;<br><br>- MeshCAM: used to create toolpaths (NC files) from the CAD files. We have tried FeatureCAM as well, which is more powereful than MeshCAM but lacks the post-processor to make the code readable by WinPC;<br><br>- CutViewer Mill: used to view the toolpaths and check for errors before actually starting to cut;<br><br>- LaserWorks: software used to communicate with the laser cutter, load DXF files and prepare the settings at which the cutting takes place.<br><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Apparatus</h3>
<p><br>The CNC machine of choice was&nbsp;a 3-axis&nbsp;<strong>Heiz&nbsp;S400-T</strong>&nbsp;equiped with a Kress&nbsp;1050 spindle and a Zero3 controller.<br><br>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Operating Principle</h2>
<p><br>The lock was designed on a simple, yet robust principle. In the picture below you can see one of the final iterations having the electronic components test fitted.<br><br>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2015/06/1-1024x440.png" alt="1"></figure>
<p><br>Looking at the picture below makes the operating principle easier to understand.<br>&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Explanation1.png" alt="Explanation"></figure>
<p><br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>As the motor spins, the 3D printed hook moves and with it the metal bolt, thus opening or closing the lock. The hook moves due to two&nbsp;nuts fixed&nbsp;on the sides. Because the hook is sitting in a groove that keeps the nuts from spinning, they have no choice but to move up or down the rod. The advantage of this mechanism is the direct contact between the motor and hook, which&nbsp;ensures that all the torque is transmitted constantly (no slip) to the bolt, practically transforming the rod into a lead-screw.<br><br>When the hook comes close to either of the QRD sensors, they send a&nbsp;&nbsp;signal to the micro controller, which in turn stops the motor and displays a message on the web interface: 'The lock is closed' (or open).<br><br>The system works as long as the bolt is placed on the hook. Should the user decide to operate the bolt manually and forget to place it back on the hook, the whole system is rendered useless. To overcome this problem, a contact was formed between the two pieces of Velcro (picture above) using the bolt itself. The larger piece of Velcro on the LHS is connected to a digital pin of the Pico an the Velcro on the RHS is connected to a GND pin. When the contact is made via the bolt, the output reads '1', meaning the bolt is placed on the hook. The contact between the bolt and Velcro connected to the digital pin is made via a smaller piece of Velcro placed in the hook. As the bolt moves, the Velcro in the hook brushes against the Velcro connected to the digital pin and thus ensuring a contact is constantly present. The advantage of this design is that it eliminates the need for moving wires, which are prone to breaking. Also, since the bolt is not connected to a power pin, there is no risk of producing a short circuit or suffering an electric shock.<br><br>The micro controller can be powered using a USB plug or by connecting the power pins to a battery pack. We recommend a 6V battery pack to ensure the motor is spinning fast enough, but this can go up to 9V with no problems excepting the increased noise.<br><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Prototyping</h2>
<h4><br><br><strong>As mentioned previously, we have been experimenting creating the lock utilising some modern micro manufacturing methods. After a lot of testing and tweaking the design, only two methods were deemed viable: laser cutting and CNC machining. Find below the pros and cons of each method.</strong><br>&nbsp;</h4>
<h3>1. 3D Printing</h3>
<p><br>Since we had some experience using desktop <a href="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/bb-labs/3d-printers/">3D printers</a>, we were able to quickly make prototypes and assess their potential to become a finished product. A short demonstration of an initial prototype can be seen below. Please note that the initial design you see has been changed but the operating principle remains the same. This prototype was made using an <a href="https://ultimaker.com/">Ultimaker </a>(original) on custom settings and 20% infill.<br><br>[video width="1920" height="1080" mp4="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/My-Movie.mp4"][/video]<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>One of the most common problem we have encountered with FDM (Fused Depositing Modelling) printers is that components with a large base area are prone to have the corners detach (lift) from the build platform. Having a heated build platform does help to some extent but never solves the problem completely.<br><br>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2015/06/53168141029215037146" alt="2015-07-10 15.48.42"></figure>
<p><br>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2015/06/95565844626444516873" alt="2015-07-10 15.49.23"></figure>
<p><br>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2015/06/75003461978114520842" alt="2015-07-10 15.49.44"></figure>
<p><br><br>Tests performed on a <a href="http://pp3dp.com/">Up! Plus 2</a> or a <a href="http://www.cel-robox.com/">CEL Robox</a>&nbsp; had less lift around the edges, but still to a noticeable degree.The issue we were having with these&nbsp;two printers was the small print beds. A full lock could not be printed so it has been sliced in half and connected together like Lego. A useful property of ABS plastic is that it can be cured with Acetone to remove any imperfections and leaves the part with a glossy surface.<br><br>Please note that this version is different from the latest one as this was design to accommodate an Espruino controller and not the new Pico version.<br><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2015/06/30415276170255984496" alt="2015-07-10 15.52.54"></figure>
<p><br>&nbsp;<br><br>Better results will be obtained with professional printers. Sites like <a href="http://www.shapeways.com/">Shapeways</a>, <a href="https://www.3dprint-uk.co.uk/">3DPRINTUK </a>or <a href="http://www.sculpteo.com/en/">Sculpteo </a>can provide quality components, but the price for this application would have been quite high.<br><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>2. Resin Casting</h3>
<p><br>This method involves considerably more work than simply sending an STL file to print. This is a 3-part process which takes more than a day to complete. The steps are described below:<br>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>2.1 Create a positive mold</h4>
<p><br>This step involved creating a positive mold from a <a href="http://www.easycomposites.co.uk/products/tooling-modelling-board/pu-high-density-model-board.aspx">high density foam</a> using the CNC machine for maximum accuracy. This process can take up to 3-4 hours for a high surface finish.<br><br>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2015/06/22816132505825856598" alt="2014-06-11 10.44.50"></figure>
<p><br>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2015/06/12112827681126042644" alt="2014-06-11 09.04.07"></figure>
<p><br>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2015/06/66982029331331258622" alt="2014-06-11 13.00.30"></figure>
<p><br>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>2.2 Create a negative mold</h4>
<p><br>After the CNC job was done, we simply placed some cardboard in the out-most groove and filled the mold up with RTV rubber. Often, the rubber is left to cure overnight before it gets peeled out of the high density foam. The initial batch of molds was made using inexpensive <a href="http://www.mbfg.co.uk/rtv-silicone/gp-3481-f.html">RTV Silicone Rubber</a>. The initial results were promising, but due to the flexible nature of the rubber, the components often had dimensional inaccuracies compared to the CAD model.<br><br>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2015/06/mold.png" alt="mold"></figure>
<p><br><br>The rubber captured all the details quite nicely. To obtain a smooth surface finish as above, the rubber was degassed before being poured into the mold. The degassing setup (picture below) consist of a vacuum pump and a vacuum chamber. After mixing the rubber, it was placed inside the chamber and the vacuum pump extracts&nbsp;most air bubbles, resulting in a thick, smooth mixture to create the mold.<br><br>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2015/06/38320620775140001359" alt="2015-07-10 11.52.01"></figure>
<p><br>&nbsp;<br><br>Wanting to improve the quality of the molds, we have started to look for addition cure&nbsp;silicone rubbers and found <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CCIQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fresources.renishaw.com%2Fen%2Fdownload%2F(0f4bcf38972240809eef0dbde325842d)&amp;ei=QbWfVeORIqOM7Abp44jACA&amp;usg=AFQjCNEX7qPiMU_47CWqIqC9JZH0MCWS1w&amp;sig2=1rdaJwvaE66I8GrOyI2JCQ&amp;bvm=bv.96952980,d.ZGU">VTV 750</a>.&nbsp;Higher viscosity and shore hardness makes it more suitable for this application. It is also less expensive (£67.50 compared to £80 for RTV) and has a longer pot life.<br><br>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2015/06/47449101668872211825" alt="2015-07-10 11.31.13"></figure>
<p><br><br>Although it is just as good at capturing fine details, and considerably stiffer than general purpose RTV, it's surface is slightly rough and some micro air bubbles can be present even after degassing. Through testing we have found limitations which allowed us to adjust the CAD model to increase it's performance.<br><br>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2015/06/06443513327571200106" alt="2015-07-10 14.19.16"></figure>
<p><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>2.3 Casting the part</h4>
<p><br>Some 24 hours after starting the process, we are able to start producing components. Preparing the resin is similar to preparing the silicone rubber for the mold:<br><br>- Mix the 2-part resin (we have used <a href="http://www.mbfg.co.uk/polyurethane-casting-resin/easyflo_60.html">Polytek&nbsp;Easy Flow 60</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://www.innovative-polymers.com/images/specs/Classic-Shore-D/IE-3075.pdf">IE-3075</a>)<br><br>- Degas the mix in the vacuum chamber<br><br>- Pour the mix in the rubber mold and leave it to cool down<br><br>In an attempt to obtain a smooth finish on both sides of the part, a rubber lid&nbsp;was made to fit inside the mold. The lid had holes drilled in it to allow for excess resin to slow out.<br><br>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2015/06/87242586295230202986" alt="2015-07-10 15.10.05"></figure>
<p><br>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2015/06/14948380384932210133" alt="2015-07-10 15.10.36"></figure>
<p><br><br>We have also experiented with pigments to give the components a different look.<br><br>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2015/06/70741382797831687684" alt="2015-07-10 15.35.50"></figure>
<p><br><br>After months of testing we decided not to pursue this route as components constantly developed air bubbles on the backside. We have tried different pouring techniques (injecting the resin using a syringe, pouring on a thin flow, etc.) but never could fully eliminate this defect. It seems a limitation of the rubber molds.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2015/06/32263174625388449161" alt="2015-07-10 15.37.26"></figure>
<p><br><br>Having molds made out of Aluminium or Steel would most likely result in a finished product, but the manufacturing costs are unjustified at this stage.<br><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>3. Laser Cutting</h3>
<p><br>This method involved a complete redesign of the lock case. The 3D model was sliced into 10 layers of 3mm thickness.We have tested both plywood and Acrylic as they are common, inexpensive materials known to produce quality results under laser cutting.<br><br>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2015/06/layer-4-1024x506.png" alt="layer 4"></figure>
<p><br>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2015/06/layer-3-1024x528.png" alt="layer 3"></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2015/06/layer-2-1024x473.png" alt="layer 2"></figure>
<p><br><br>For the physical build, we have chosen to laser-cut 3mm plywood. To do this, the CAD model was used to create a DXF file with all the layers laid down on a 600mm x 300mm sheet. This method was by far the fastest and most inexpensive, as the material was approximately £4 and takes approximately 20 minutes to cut out on a Class IV laser (add £20 for booking the machine&nbsp;for an hour).<br><br>&nbsp;</p>

<p><br>&nbsp;<br><br>At first there were some concerns about structural resistance of this design as only the top 2 layers actually take the load when the lock is in operation. A quick test having a 90kg person standing directly on top of it (all the force is applied on the bolt) revealed that it is actually quite resistant. Also, because the design is modular, the user can simply increase the number of top layers without having to change anything (except longer screws, of course).<br><br>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2015/06/16533916774381233454" alt="2015-02-09 16.33.12"></figure>
<p><br><br>It was mentioned that this layer design works with plywood and Acrylic, but it can be made out of any sheet material which is 3mm thick. Also, the laser cutter was preferred for its speed and contribution to the learning curve but it can be easily cut using a CNC machine. Again, this is entirely the user's choice.<br><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>4. CNC Machining</h3>
<p><br>We were impressed by the accuracy of the CNC but the silicone rubber molds had their limitations. As such, we have decided to use the CNC to create the actual lock. The material selection is quite broad, ranging from wood to Aluminium or Acrylic. We have experimented using English Oak as it is quite hard, affordable and easy to mill.<br><br>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2015/06/3d-lock-1024x432.png" alt="3d lock"></figure>
<p><br>&nbsp;<br><br>This design was changes slightly compared to the initial 3D printed one in order to accommodate the latest micro controllers.<br><br>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2015/06/3d-lock-21.png" alt="3d lock 2"></figure>
<p><br><br>The result of an initial test is displayed below. The total time including manual tool changing was approximately 3 hours per hlaf.<br><br>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2015/06/27826487172012498779" alt="2015-07-13 15.51.27"></figure>
<p><br>&nbsp;<br><br>The surface finish is impressive. The only extra finishing method would be staining the wood, coating it or anything the user decides fitting.<br><br>&nbsp;</p>

<p><br>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p><br>This project had a steep learning curve but it allowed us to explore some manufacturing areas that coupled with our knowledge of software lead to the creation of a finished product that started as nothing more than an idea on a blank piece of paper. We have learned the advantages and limitations of each manufacturing method and were able to critically appraise them in order to focus on the ones with the most potential of becoming a reality.<br><br><br>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>BB's Oculus Idea&nbsp;</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Revolutionising the World of CAD</h2>
<p><br>In the recent hit Iron Man movies, main character Tony Stark designs and develops his many wonderful inventions by using interactive holograms that he can spin, resize and dismantle with simple hand gestures. Of course, these are just movies and the idea that this is something we could do in the real world all seems a bit fanciful – except maybe it isn’t.<br><br>Whilst the idea of interacting with a holographic image is still the exclusive domain of popular fiction, new developments in virtual reality and gesture detection have opened up a world of possibilities – and this got us asking: can we combine these technologies?<br><br>We think the answer is yes.<br><br>For the past couple of years, we’ve maintained a keen interest in 3D printing and laser cutting technology - and it is here that we think these new technologies can be combined and applied.<br><br>Because 3D prints can take hours - or even days - to complete, it is imperative that the model is correct before manufacture begins. And that’s before we have even considered the financial implications associated with wasting costly manufacturing materials.<br><br>Imagine you need to manufacture several parts that will be used to assemble a larger model; with this concept not only could you visually inspect each model before manufacture begins, but you could take them in your hands and fit them together to test the designs. If something needs to be slightly re-sized or doesn’t quite align properly, this can be picked up on much earlier in the design process, potentially saving a great deal of time and materials.<br><br>Our proposed solution is to combine the 3D virtual reality features of the Oculus Rift with the gesture detections features of the Leap Motion, so that a virtual 3D model can be handled as if it were real.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Technology Behind The Idea</h2>
<p><br>Launched on Kickstarter as a virtual reality headset for video games, the Oculus Rift has captured the imagination of software developers around the world, and not just those working on video games either. Tech demos and apps are popping up on the Web all the time and range from allowing users to explore Google maps to being part of research projects into autism.<br><br>With a wide field of view and low latency head tracking, the Oculus Rift provides an immersive experience for the user. However, with head tracking as the only user input currently available for the Oculus Rift, it is clearly not very practical when it comes to manipulating 3D models or interacting with gaming environments.<br><br>There are more developers experimenting with other hand held motion controllers, such as the Razer Hydra, PlayStation Move and Nintendo Wiimotes, as well as natural interfaces, such as Kinect - but it is the Leap Motion that we find particularly appealing.<br><br>The Leap Motion uses infrared sensors to provide touch-free 3D motion control and motion-sensing, which is able to track the position of individual fingers, rather than just broad hand gestures that limit the other devices mentioned.<br><br>In fact, the developers of Leap Motion claim that the device can track movement of 10 digits to within 0.01mm, with an average processing time of just 3.5 milliseconds for one hand or 6 milliseconds for two.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Integrating the Technology</h2>
<p><br>At this point, things need a little bit more thought than simply strapping a headset on and placing a sensor on a desk, however. Consider a situation where the user looks straight ahead and holds their hands out in front of them, above the sensor – they will see their virtual hands in front of them, exactly as they would their real hands if they weren’t wearing the headset.<br><br>Now consider, what would happen if the user looks directly up without moving their arms. As far as the Leap Motion is concerned, the user’s hands haven’t moved, so the user’s virtual hands remain unmoved on the Oculus Rift display, outstretched in front of them. All of a sudden, virtual reality no longer adequately mimics the real world.<br><br>Whilst this disconnect could threaten to scupper the usefulness of this concept, the solution is actually devilishly simple. In fact it requires little more than a roll of double-sided sticky tape to attach the Leap Motion sensor directly to the front of the Oculus Rift headset so that it shares the user’s field of view. By doing this, the Leap Motion can faithfully reproduce the user’s hand gestures and movements in the virtual space while maintaining the spatial relationship between the user’s eyes and hands in the virtual space.<br><br>Of course, there is also the added benefit of giving the user much greater freedom to move around as they are no longer forced to remain within the sensors rather modest field of view (said to be approximately 25cm in height from the sensor).<br><br>Ultimately, we would prefer a more elegant solution to attaching the Leap Motion sensor to the Oculus Rift headset than sticky tap – the most likely alternative being to design a mounting bracket that would clip both devices together. Naturally this would be manufactured using a 3D printer.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Into The Future</h2>
<p><br>With both of these devices working in tandem, we have already been able to see a block loaded into a virtual space, which we can then move around the space using virtual copies of our hands based on what the Leap Motion sees.<br><br>Next, we believe it is just a case of exploiting the Oculus Rift’s support for the Unity game engine to allow users to take their .stl files (the standard format for CAD software) and import the 3d models contained within them into the Oculus Rift’s virtual space, where the user can then manipulate and interact with the models to their hearts content.<br><br>While it is still early days for this concept, ultimately, Tony Stark-like CAD may very well be literally at our fingertips...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Leap Motion Review&nbsp;</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The New Kid on the Block</h2>
<p><br>In 2006, Nintendo made headlines with their Wii console by making the user input predominantly gesture recognition based. At the time, their rivals at Microsoft and Sony dismissed this as being little more than a marketing gimmick that gamers would soon grow tired of.<br><br>Fast forward to the present day and Microsoft and Sony now have their own gesture detection hardware competing with Nintendo’s. What’s more, the explosion in smartphone and tablet sales means that gestures such as swiping, pinching and dragging have become second nature to most of us. It would now seem that gesture detection is something that is here to stay.<br><br>So far only Microsoft, with their Kinect device, have really enjoyed any great mainstream success creating a controller free interface. However, there is now an eagerly-anticipated, new challenger on the scene in the form of the Leap Motion.<br><br>This remarkably small device relies purely on two cameras and three infrared LEDs mounted inside a static 3in box. The cameras and LEDs combine to provide touch-free 3D motion control and motion-sensing, which is capable of tracking the position of individual fingers, rather than just broad hand gestures – a common limitation of many of its competitors.<br><br>In fact, the developers of Leap Motion claim that the fidelity of the device is so good it can track movement of 10 digits to within 0.01mm, with an average processing time of just 3.5 milliseconds for one hand or 6 milliseconds for two. In other words, they believe the Leap Motion can provide an experience that is, for all intents and purposes, latency free.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Getting Going</h2>
<p><br>Setting up the Leap Motion device is simple enough – plug the proprietary USB cable into the Leap Motion device and your PC and then download and run the installer from the Leap Motion website.<br><br>When installation is completed, the Leap Motion automatically calibrates itself, taking into account ambient light levels and attempting to compensate for any smudges or smears on the sensor’s surface. Helpfully, it actually displays warning messages if smudges are detected on the sensor, suggesting that the user cleans the glass. Similarly if other IR sources are detected that may intere with the sensor, the user is warned and the sensor attempts to compensate.<br><br>In actual fact, the Leap Motions re-calibrates every time the PC it is connected to is powered on, which is a good job as ambient light levels can obviously change quite considerably from one session to another.<br><br>To actually start using the Leap Motion, you are going to need some apps. The installer comes pre-loaded with a couple of rudimentary apps, which are basically just tech demos. If you want anything else, these come courtesy of the Airspace Store – the Leap Motion’s equivalent of the iTunes store. You need to sign up in order to be able to log in but once you have signed up, there are plenty of apps on offer.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Putting It Through It’s Paces</h2>
<p><br>For those who were eagerly anticipating the ‘out of the box’ support for controlling Windows 8 that was promised but ultimately failed to materialize, one of the first apps to download from Airspace Store should be Touchless For Windows - an app that allows you to do exactly what the Leap Motion developers originally promised.<br><br>Touchless for WIndows essentially creates an imaginary touch panel in front of your screen that allows you to control Windows 8 using the sort of gestures that are used all the time on tablets and smartphones. At least that’s the idea.<br><br>While it does work, it can be a fiddly and frustrating experience. The gestures can be unpredictable and unreliable – sometimes it will do exactly as you want but too frequently, it is as if it has a will of its own.<br><br>Like Kinect, it can also suffer from the problem of occulsion - when part of the body is hidden from the sensor by another part of the body. In other words, if you hold your hands palms down over the sensor, sure enough, you can see all 10 fingers being tracked, but turn your hands so that they are perpendicular to the sensor and all of a sudden the fingers furthest from the sensor start disappearing.<br><br>Whilst Kinect mitigates against this as best it can by extrapolating what data it is able to gather, the Leap Motion does not seem to have any clever tricks and so everything just becomes a bit of a mess. That said, this only becomes apparent if the app takes advantage individual finger tracking - for many apps this simply is not the case though.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Untapped Potential</h2>
<p><br>When it does work, it is clear that it simply offers a different method of doing the same things we do all the time, not necessarily a better method. That, allied with the potential inconvenience of having to continually hold your arm out-stretched above the sensor, makes it clear that this is not a game-changer that is going to drive a sudden shift away from traditional mouse and keyboard input - at least for as far as general computer use is concerned. But then again, the Leap Motion developers themselves have stressed that the Leap Motion is not intended as a replacement for either of these.<br><br>That’s not to say that the Leap Motion couldn’t lead to something revolutionary, though. Already, developers have been used in conjunction with the Oculus Rift so allow users to interact with virtual items in a virtual world. It is in scenarios like this, where more traditional methods of input are not viable, that this device could potentially shine.<br><br>Thinking about Kinect for a moment, it’s generally accepted that it is best used when incorporated into things like sports or dancing video games – in other words, when used for activities that cannot easily be mapped to a traditional game controller. When applied to more traditional video games, on the other hand, it usually feels like it has been crowbarred in and the gaming experience flounders.<br><br>Similarly, the Leap Motion is most promising when it does not try to mimic the functionality of tried and tested devices, but rather when it offers something new and different. Hopefully, in time, the Leap Motion will be able to find its own little niche that will allow it to realise the potential that it clearly has.<br><br>Until then, whilst the latency-free performance is certainly a big plus point, the need for the gesture detection to be made more<br>robust, will mean that the Leap Motion will remain more of a curiosity than a necessity.</p>

<h1>Oculus Rift Review&nbsp;</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Launched on Kickstarter after completing an overwhelmingly successful funding campaign, the Oculus Rift is a virtual reality headset for video games, which has managed to capture the imagination of not only games developers but software developers in general.<br><br>In addition to the inevitable plethora of flight simulators and first person shooter games from the target market, we are already seeing tech demos and apps popping up all over the Web for many things besides gaming. These range from allowing users to explore Google maps to being an integral part in studies into autism.<br><br>And so that begs the question - is the Oculus Rift worth a look?<br><br>Oculus VR, the developers behind the Rift, promise a wide field of view and low latency head tracking that provides an immersive experience for the user. If truth be told, we found that the latency of the head tracking is not always as stellar as they claim. Otherwise, it seems that they have more or less delivered on their promises.<br><br>I say more or less because things aren’t perfect but it’s important to appreciate that the units that are currently being rolled out to Kickstarter backers are actually branded as ‘development kits’ - the official retail release for the hardware is actually still some way off. Indeed, on their Kickstarter page, the Oculus VR describes these dev kits as essentially being ‘early prototypes’ and they promise that the final retail units will be improved in virtually every aspect.<br><br>Chief amongst these improvements is a much needed increase in the resolution compared to the dev kits. Currently, the Rift has only a modest resolution, which delivers slightly disappointing results in comparison to when the same graphics are rendered on a monitor. Considering the display for each eye piece is only a mere 640x1080 – aggregated to give an overall display of 1280x800 – this is not particularly surprising, however.<br><br>In part, this problem is due to a late decision by Oculus VR to swap to displays that are 30% larger than those that were originally intended for inclusion, while leaving the resolution of the displays unchanged. Naturally, this causes the pixels to look simply huge.<br><br>Of course, the upshot of this revision is that it gives a truly fantastic field of view, which is absolutely integral to creating an immersive experience. This immersion is without doubt one of the key selling points for the Rift and Oculus VR have achieved this by making the user genuinely feel like the virtual image is wrapped around them.<br><br>Faced with a decision between having a less than ideal resolution or displays that didn’t achieve the necessary feeling of immersion because they were too small, Oculus VR definitely made the right call in increasing the display size.<br><br>What’s more, with a new generation of video games consoles set to raise the bar even further in terms of graphically fidelity towards the end of 2013, an improved ‘HD’ version of the Oculus Rift is already on the horizon – boosting the resolution from 1280x800 to 1920x1080.<br><br>This has already been shown off at a number of industry events, including the hugely popular E3 gaming conference, and so far the feedback has been universally positive.<br><br>The HD version also apparently shows off a vast improvement in the colour contrast in comparison to the dev kits, making the visuals look far more vibrant. Presumably this is just one of the many improvements promised by Oculus VR.<br>Looking beyond the visuals, the head tracking is also pretty impressive. Accelerometers and gyroscopes monitor the direction, rotation and angle of the users head and then translate this directly into the software. This allows the user’s head movements to be faithfully mimicked in the virtual environment.<br><br>There is a catch here though – for some users, the affect of the head tracking can become nausea-inducing. By no means is this a problem for all apps and games but the small amount of latency that some display, can be sufficient to have a rather unpleasant affect on the user.<br><br>Although Oculus VR dismiss this as something that will pass once the user has become accustomed to the Rift, it does seem to have a polarising affect amongst users and their willingness to continue using it.<br><br>Beyond that, the only real shortcoming of the head tracking is that the current development kit cannot detect your position. Imagine you see something in the virtual environment that you want to move your head towards it to have closer look, or there is a ledge you want to peer over – well, sadly in these cases, the Rift does have much to offer.<br><br>Thankfully, this is yet another example of the Rift dev kits essentially being prototypes, as Oculus VR have promised that this will be a feature in the retail version.<br><br>Unfortunately, while Oculus VR has done a rather good job of designing the headset, they seem to have forgotten that there is actually more to the Rift than just the headset. The headset is connected to a simple control box (which in turn plugs into your PC or Mac) and the cable connecting the two seems to have been the victim of a glaring design oversight – the length of the cable woefully inadequate.<br><br>So short, In fact, that as soon as the user starts to move their head around, the control box will immediately be in danger of being pulled from the desk - and that’s just when sitting down. If the user wants to stand up, as many instinctively do as soon as they become immersed in the experience, the only option is to physically hold the control box, otherwise it just dangles in mid-air as the cable it too short to reach the desk.<br><br>That grumble aside, they have actually done a very good job with the headset itself. It’s reasonably comfortable and certainly feels very secure when being worn - the adjustable straps work a treat at allowing the user to achieve a nice, snug fit.<br>Also, the dev kits come with a small selection of lens that can easily swapped in and out depending on the quality of the user’s eye sight. Even better, there are individual lens for each eye so user’s with one eye stronger than the other need not worry.<br>By now it will come as no surprise that the headset design is yet another area in which we can expect improvements when the retail version arrives. The HD version already shows off a much sleeker design, which is smaller and lighter.<br><br>When all things are considered, it is still early days for the Rift. The dev kits currently available are clearly limited but do show that there is tremendous potential.<br><br>A note of caution, however - to use an adage of the games industry - ‘it’s the apps that sell hardware, not the hardware itself’.<br>It would appear that there is no problem on this front though, since Oculus VR have just announced that an official app store, named Oculus Share, will be launching soon. Although initially it will be aimed purely at helping developers share demos and experiences that they have created, this will ultimately be opened up to the general public.<br><br>That said, while the Rift is intended primarily for video games, I don’t see it particularly revolutionizing that industry. Like Microsoft Kinect, it will become another way to play games, but it will never become the way to play games.<br><br>Instead, it is the myriad of other applications of this technology that we will see the most exciting developments. Already developers are looking at trying to find innovative ways to use the Rift but they are yet to even scratch the surface of what could be possible…</p>
