<h1>Blueberry : BB's Oculus Idea&nbsp;</h1>
<p>Created by Administrator on Jan 07, 2016</p>
<h2>Revolutionising the World of CAD</h2>
<p><br>In the recent hit Iron Man movies, main character Tony Stark designs and develops his many wonderful inventions by using interactive holograms that he can spin, resize and dismantle with simple hand gestures. Of course, these are just movies and the idea that this is something we could do in the real world all seems a bit fanciful – except maybe it isn’t.<br><br>Whilst the idea of interacting with a holographic image is still the exclusive domain of popular fiction, new developments in virtual reality and gesture detection have opened up a world of possibilities – and this got us asking: can we combine these technologies?<br><br>We think the answer is yes.<br><br>For the past couple of years, we’ve maintained a keen interest in 3D printing and laser cutting technology - and it is here that we think these new technologies can be combined and applied.<br><br>Because 3D prints can take hours - or even days - to complete, it is imperative that the model is correct before manufacture begins. And that’s before we have even considered the financial implications associated with wasting costly manufacturing materials.<br><br>Imagine you need to manufacture several parts that will be used to assemble a larger model; with this concept not only could you visually inspect each model before manufacture begins, but you could take them in your hands and fit them together to test the designs. If something needs to be slightly re-sized or doesn’t quite align properly, this can be picked up on much earlier in the design process, potentially saving a great deal of time and materials.<br><br>Our proposed solution is to combine the 3D virtual reality features of the Oculus Rift with the gesture detections features of the Leap Motion, so that a virtual 3D model can be handled as if it were real.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Technology Behind The Idea</h2>
<p><br>Launched on Kickstarter as a virtual reality headset for video games, the Oculus Rift has captured the imagination of software developers around the world, and not just those working on video games either. Tech demos and apps are popping up on the Web all the time and range from allowing users to explore Google maps to being part of research projects into autism.<br><br>With a wide field of view and low latency head tracking, the Oculus Rift provides an immersive experience for the user. However, with head tracking as the only user input currently available for the Oculus Rift, it is clearly not very practical when it comes to manipulating 3D models or interacting with gaming environments.<br><br>There are more developers experimenting with other hand held motion controllers, such as the Razer Hydra, PlayStation Move and Nintendo Wiimotes, as well as natural interfaces, such as Kinect - but it is the Leap Motion that we find particularly appealing.<br><br>The Leap Motion uses infrared sensors to provide touch-free 3D motion control and motion-sensing, which is able to track the position of individual fingers, rather than just broad hand gestures that limit the other devices mentioned.<br><br>In fact, the developers of Leap Motion claim that the device can track movement of 10 digits to within 0.01mm, with an average processing time of just 3.5 milliseconds for one hand or 6 milliseconds for two.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Integrating the Technology</h2>
<p><br>At this point, things need a little bit more thought than simply strapping a headset on and placing a sensor on a desk, however. Consider a situation where the user looks straight ahead and holds their hands out in front of them, above the sensor – they will see their virtual hands in front of them, exactly as they would their real hands if they weren’t wearing the headset.<br><br>Now consider, what would happen if the user looks directly up without moving their arms. As far as the Leap Motion is concerned, the user’s hands haven’t moved, so the user’s virtual hands remain unmoved on the Oculus Rift display, outstretched in front of them. All of a sudden, virtual reality no longer adequately mimics the real world.<br><br>Whilst this disconnect could threaten to scupper the usefulness of this concept, the solution is actually devilishly simple. In fact it requires little more than a roll of double-sided sticky tape to attach the Leap Motion sensor directly to the front of the Oculus Rift headset so that it shares the user’s field of view. By doing this, the Leap Motion can faithfully reproduce the user’s hand gestures and movements in the virtual space while maintaining the spatial relationship between the user’s eyes and hands in the virtual space.<br><br>Of course, there is also the added benefit of giving the user much greater freedom to move around as they are no longer forced to remain within the sensors rather modest field of view (said to be approximately 25cm in height from the sensor).<br><br>Ultimately, we would prefer a more elegant solution to attaching the Leap Motion sensor to the Oculus Rift headset than sticky tap – the most likely alternative being to design a mounting bracket that would clip both devices together. Naturally this would be manufactured using a 3D printer.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Into The Future</h2>
<p><br>With both of these devices working in tandem, we have already been able to see a block loaded into a virtual space, which we can then move around the space using virtual copies of our hands based on what the Leap Motion sees.<br><br>Next, we believe it is just a case of exploiting the Oculus Rift’s support for the Unity game engine to allow users to take their .stl files (the standard format for CAD software) and import the 3d models contained within them into the Oculus Rift’s virtual space, where the user can then manipulate and interact with the models to their hearts content.<br><br>While it is still early days for this concept, ultimately, Tony Stark-like CAD may very well be literally at our fingertips...</p>
