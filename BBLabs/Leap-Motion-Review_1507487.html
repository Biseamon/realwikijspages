In 2006, Nintendo made headlines with their Wii console by making the user input predominantly gesture recognition based. At the time, their rivals at Microsoft and Sony dismissed this as being little more than a marketing gimmick that gamers would soon grow tired of.<br/>
<br/>
Fast forward to the present day and Microsoft and Sony now have their own gesture detection hardware competing with Nintendo’s. What’s more, the explosion in smartphone and tablet sales means that gestures such as swiping, pinching and dragging have become second nature to most of us. It would now seem that gesture detection is something that is here to stay.<br/>
<br/>
So far only Microsoft, with their Kinect device, have really enjoyed any great mainstream success creating a controller free interface. However, there is now an eagerly-anticipated, new challenger on the scene in the form of the Leap Motion.<br/>
<br/>
This remarkably small device relies purely on two cameras and three infrared LEDs mounted inside a static 3in box. The cameras and LEDs combine to provide touch-free 3D motion control and motion-sensing, which is capable of tracking the position of individual fingers, rather than just broad hand gestures – a common limitation of many of its competitors.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, the developers of Leap Motion claim that the fidelity of the device is so good it can track movement of 10 digits to within 0.01mm, with an average processing time of just 3.5 milliseconds for one hand or 6 milliseconds for two. In other words, they believe the Leap Motion can provide an experience that is, for all intents and purposes, latency free.<br/>
<h2 id="LeapMotionReview-GettingGoing">Getting Going</h2><br/>
Setting up the Leap Motion device is simple enough – plug the proprietary USB cable into the Leap Motion device and your PC and then download and run the installer from the Leap Motion website.<br/>
<br/>
When installation is completed, the Leap Motion automatically calibrates itself, taking into account ambient light levels and attempting to compensate for any smudges or smears on the sensor’s surface. Helpfully, it actually displays warning messages if smudges are detected on the sensor, suggesting that the user cleans the glass. Similarly if other IR sources are detected that may intere with the sensor, the user is warned and the sensor attempts to compensate.<br/>
<br/>
In actual fact, the Leap Motions re-calibrates every time the PC it is connected to is powered on, which is a good job as ambient light levels can obviously change quite considerably from one session to another.<br/>
<br/>
To actually start using the Leap Motion, you are going to need some apps. The installer comes pre-loaded with a couple of rudimentary apps, which are basically just tech demos. If you want anything else, these come courtesy of the Airspace Store – the Leap Motion’s equivalent of the iTunes store. You need to sign up in order to be able to log in but once you have signed up, there are plenty of apps on offer.<br/>
<h2 id="LeapMotionReview-PuttingItThroughIt’sPaces">Putting It Through It’s Paces</h2><br/>
For those who were eagerly anticipating the ‘out of the box’ support for controlling Windows 8 that was promised but ultimately failed to materialize, one of the first apps to download from Airspace Store should be Touchless For Windows - an app that allows you to do exactly what the Leap Motion developers originally promised.<br/>
<br/>
Touchless for WIndows essentially creates an imaginary touch panel in front of your screen that allows you to control Windows 8 using the sort of gestures that are used all the time on tablets and smartphones. At least that’s the idea.<br/>
<br/>
While it does work, it can be a fiddly and frustrating experience. The gestures can be unpredictable and unreliable – sometimes it will do exactly as you want but too frequently, it is as if it has a will of its own.<br/>
<br/>
Like Kinect, it can also suffer from the problem of occulsion - when part of the body is hidden from the sensor by another part of the body. In other words, if you hold your hands palms down over the sensor, sure enough, you can see all 10 fingers being tracked, but turn your hands so that they are perpendicular to the sensor and all of a sudden the fingers furthest from the sensor start disappearing.<br/>
<br/>
Whilst Kinect mitigates against this as best it can by extrapolating what data it is able to gather, the Leap Motion does not seem to have any clever tricks and so everything just becomes a bit of a mess. That said, this only becomes apparent if the app takes advantage individual finger tracking - for many apps this simply is not the case though.<br/>
<h2 id="LeapMotionReview-UntappedPotential">Untapped Potential</h2><br/>
When it does work, it is clear that it simply offers a different method of doing the same things we do all the time, not necessarily a better method. That, allied with the potential inconvenience of having to continually hold your arm out-stretched above the sensor, makes it clear that this is not a game-changer that is going to drive a sudden shift away from traditional mouse and keyboard input - at least for as far as general computer use is concerned. But then again, the Leap Motion developers themselves have stressed that the Leap Motion is not intended as a replacement for either of these.<br/>
<br/>
That’s not to say that the Leap Motion couldn’t lead to something revolutionary, though. Already, developers have been used in conjunction with the Oculus Rift so allow users to interact with virtual items in a virtual world. It is in scenarios like this, where more traditional methods of input are not viable, that this device could potentially shine.<br/>
<br/>
Thinking about Kinect for a moment, it’s generally accepted that it is best used when incorporated into things like sports or dancing video games – in other words, when used for activities that cannot easily be mapped to a traditional game controller. When applied to more traditional video games, on the other hand, it usually feels like it has been crowbarred in and the gaming experience flounders.<br/>
<br/>
Similarly, the Leap Motion is most promising when it does not try to mimic the functionality of tried and tested devices, but rather when it offers something new and different. Hopefully, in time, the Leap Motion will be able to find its own little niche that will allow it to realise the potential that it clearly has.<br/>
<br/>
Until then, whilst the latency-free performance is certainly a big plus point, the need for the gesture detection to be made more<br/>
robust, will mean that the Leap Motion will remain more of a curiosity than a necessity.
