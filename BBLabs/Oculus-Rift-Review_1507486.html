                    Launched on Kickstarter after completing an overwhelmingly successful funding campaign, the Oculus Rift is a virtual reality headset for video games, which has managed to capture the imagination of not only games developers but software developers in general.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the inevitable plethora of flight simulators and first person shooter games from the target market, we are already seeing tech demos and apps popping up all over the Web for many things besides gaming. These range from allowing users to explore Google maps to being an integral part in studies into autism.<br/>
<br/>
And so that begs the question - is the Oculus Rift worth a look?<br/>
<br/>
Oculus VR, the developers behind the Rift, promise a wide field of view and low latency head tracking that provides an immersive experience for the user. If truth be told, we found that the latency of the head tracking is not always as stellar as they claim. Otherwise, it seems that they have more or less delivered on their promises.<br/>
<br/>
I say more or less because things aren’t perfect but it’s important to appreciate that the units that are currently being rolled out to Kickstarter backers are actually branded as ‘development kits’ - the official retail release for the hardware is actually still some way off. Indeed, on their Kickstarter page, the Oculus VR describes these dev kits as essentially being ‘early prototypes’ and they promise that the final retail units will be improved in virtually every aspect.<br/>
<br/>
Chief amongst these improvements is a much needed increase in the resolution compared to the dev kits. Currently, the Rift has only a modest resolution, which delivers slightly disappointing results in comparison to when the same graphics are rendered on a monitor. Considering the display for each eye piece is only a mere 640x1080 – aggregated to give an overall display of 1280x800 – this is not particularly surprising, however.<br/>
<br/>
In part, this problem is due to a late decision by Oculus VR to swap to displays that are 30% larger than those that were originally intended for inclusion, while leaving the resolution of the displays unchanged. Naturally, this causes the pixels to look simply huge.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, the upshot of this revision is that it gives a truly fantastic field of view, which is absolutely integral to creating an immersive experience. This immersion is without doubt one of the key selling points for the Rift and Oculus VR have achieved this by making the user genuinely feel like the virtual image is wrapped around them.<br/>
<br/>
Faced with a decision between having a less than ideal resolution or displays that didn’t achieve the necessary feeling of immersion because they were too small, Oculus VR definitely made the right call in increasing the display size.<br/>
<br/>
What’s more, with a new generation of video games consoles set to raise the bar even further in terms of graphically fidelity towards the end of 2013, an improved ‘HD’ version of the Oculus Rift is already on the horizon – boosting the resolution from 1280x800 to 1920x1080.<br/>
<br/>
This has already been shown off at a number of industry events, including the hugely popular E3 gaming conference, and so far the feedback has been universally positive.<br/>
<br/>
The HD version also apparently shows off a vast improvement in the colour contrast in comparison to the dev kits, making the visuals look far more vibrant. Presumably this is just one of the many improvements promised by Oculus VR.<br/>
Looking beyond the visuals, the head tracking is also pretty impressive. Accelerometers and gyroscopes monitor the direction, rotation and angle of the users head and then translate this directly into the software. This allows the user’s head movements to be faithfully mimicked in the virtual environment.<br/>
<br/>
There is a catch here though – for some users, the affect of the head tracking can become nausea-inducing. By no means is this a problem for all apps and games but the small amount of latency that some display, can be sufficient to have a rather unpleasant affect on the user.<br/>
<br/>
Although Oculus VR dismiss this as something that will pass once the user has become accustomed to the Rift, it does seem to have a polarising affect amongst users and their willingness to continue using it.<br/>
<br/>
Beyond that, the only real shortcoming of the head tracking is that the current development kit cannot detect your position. Imagine you see something in the virtual environment that you want to move your head towards it to have closer look, or there is a ledge you want to peer over – well, sadly in these cases, the Rift does have much to offer.<br/>
<br/>
Thankfully, this is yet another example of the Rift dev kits essentially being prototypes, as Oculus VR have promised that this will be a feature in the retail version.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, while Oculus VR has done a rather good job of designing the headset, they seem to have forgotten that there is actually more to the Rift than just the headset. The headset is connected to a simple control box (which in turn plugs into your PC or Mac) and the cable connecting the two seems to have been the victim of a glaring design oversight – the length of the cable woefully inadequate.<br/>
<br/>
So short, In fact, that as soon as the user starts to move their head around, the control box will immediately be in danger of being pulled from the desk - and that’s just when sitting down. If the user wants to stand up, as many instinctively do as soon as they become immersed in the experience, the only option is to physically hold the control box, otherwise it just dangles in mid-air as the cable it too short to reach the desk.<br/>
<br/>
That grumble aside, they have actually done a very good job with the headset itself. It’s reasonably comfortable and certainly feels very secure when being worn - the adjustable straps work a treat at allowing the user to achieve a nice, snug fit.<br/>
Also, the dev kits come with a small selection of lens that can easily swapped in and out depending on the quality of the user’s eye sight. Even better, there are individual lens for each eye so user’s with one eye stronger than the other need not worry.<br/>
By now it will come as no surprise that the headset design is yet another area in which we can expect improvements when the retail version arrives. The HD version already shows off a much sleeker design, which is smaller and lighter.<br/>
<br/>
When all things are considered, it is still early days for the Rift. The dev kits currently available are clearly limited but do show that there is tremendous potential.<br/>
<br/>
A note of caution, however - to use an adage of the games industry - ‘it’s the apps that sell hardware, not the hardware itself’.<br/>
It would appear that there is no problem on this front though, since Oculus VR have just announced that an official app store, named Oculus Share, will be launching soon. Although initially it will be aimed purely at helping developers share demos and experiences that they have created, this will ultimately be opened up to the general public.<br/>
<br/>
That said, while the Rift is intended primarily for video games, I don’t see it particularly revolutionizing that industry. Like Microsoft Kinect, it will become another way to play games, but it will never become the way to play games.<br/>
<br/>
Instead, it is the myriad of other applications of this technology that we will see the most exciting developments. Already developers are looking at trying to find innovative ways to use the Rift but they are yet to even scratch the surface of what could be possible…
