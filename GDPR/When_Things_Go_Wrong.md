# GDPR - When things go wrong

## Personal data breach

Please report any of the following security incidents to Duncan Forsyth, by email.

- access by an unauthorised third party;
- sending personal data to an incorrect recipient; 
- computing devices containing personal data being lost or stolen; 
- alteration of personal data without permission; and
- loss of availability of personal data.
- **sending personal data offshore without a processor-controller contract specifically permitting that**;  Please talk to Martin Green about a technical work-around.

When a breach has happened, please consider that we may be contractually bound to treat it confidentially, within the limits of the law. 



## Lack of lawful basis

If you find we're storing personal data that we shouldn't be storing, then that puts us in a bit of a bind.

There’s a tension in the regulations:

- We’re not allowed to erase personal data except by our advertised retention policy that our subject is well-informed about. If we did delete it, we’d be infringing their right to access. And in some cases , their right to portability.
- On the other hand, we’re not allowed to store personal data except where we have an advertised privacy policy, and a defensible reason for holding it

By the letter of the regulations we might infer that we’re supposed to:

- update our privacy policy, and set our retention policy for that particular data to some small period that allows for people to exercise their rights before we delete the data
- take steps to ensure that the data subjects are informed

For many kinds of data this will seem wildly inappropriate.

Weigh up the factors:

- Whilst we’re holding the data we’re unnecessarily increasing their risks.
- If we were to delete it, will the subject suffer from the loss of availability of the data?
Whether we should immediately delete it is a judgement call.
 
If there's a noticeable loss to the data subject from lack of availability, then report it as a data breach - as described above. 



## Reporting data breaches to the ICO

When a personal data breach has occurred, we will need to establish the likelihood and severity of the resulting risks to the data subjects. If it’s likely that there will be a risk then we must notify the ICO; if it’s unlikely then we don’t have to report it.  We must assess the potential adverse consequences for individuals, based on how serious these are, and how likely they are to happen.

However, we must always document the breach and our decision-making process. 

Examples of when we would need to report the breach to the ICO:

- Where a copy of the database is stolen. This leaves the data subjects little recourse if their personal data is processed inappropriately by the thief.
- Where data transfer has opened up a risk of identity theft or other fraud.
- Where the content of the data may cause the subject to be exposed to financial loss, damage to reputation, or loss of professional confidentiality.
- Exposure of any special [category data.]([Lawful_Basis_Of_Activity](/GDPR/Lawful_Basis_Of_Activity))

Examples of when we would not need to report the breach to the ICO:

- Loss or inappropriate alteration of a staff telephone list.
- Accidental data transfer to the wrong department of an organisation, where the department in receipt is trusted.

For more details about assessing risk, please see [section IV of the Article 29 Working Party guidelines.](http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/just/document.cfm?doc_id=47741)



## Reporting data breaches to the subjects

As above, an assessment needs to be made. Whereas the criteria for reporting to the ICO is likely risk, the criteria for reporting to the data subject is high risk.
