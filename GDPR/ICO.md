# ICO

We are registered with the Information Commissioner's Office:

- Blueberry Consultants Ltd - https://ico.org.uk/ESDWebPages/Entry/Z3121457
- Blueberry Software Ltd - https://ico.org.uk/ESDWebPages/Entry/Z3121349
- Blueberry Systems Ltd - https://ico.org.uk/ESDWebPages/Entry/ZA242346

We have previously told the ICO that we process sensitive information, specifically:

- physical or mental health details
- offences and alleged offences
- racial or ethnic origin
- religious or other beliefs of a similar nature

I don't think we made an active choice to do that, I think we accepted the template for our type of business and didn't think too much about whether it was our customers or us that were processing, or controlling, the data. 

I am aware of two situations where we might be processing data in a fashion requiring our registration:

- trouble-shooting on live systems that might expose us to personal data controlled by a customer
- performing processing to make anonymous or pseudonymous personal data controlled by a customer for later use as test data in the development of software

To change or cancel our entry we can follow the instructions at: https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/register/change/ 

( BB Consultants and BB Systems might not need to pay the data protection fee, because we’re not a controller for any data that isn’t exempted. BB Software might still need to, though. )



> Not everyone needs to register
>  
> An organisation does not need to register if it's only processing the following categories of data:
>  
>  - staff administration (including payroll);
>  - accounts or records (ie invoices and payments);
>  - advertising, marketing and public relations (in connection with your own business activity).
