<h1>GDPR - Customers Asking for Advice&nbsp;</h1>
<p>This article is for Project Managers fielding general questions about the GDPR from customers where the customer is asking about their own processing.</p>
<p><strong>Note well:</strong>&nbsp;Do&nbsp;<strong><u>not&nbsp;</u></strong>present our advice as expert.&nbsp;We are not yet expert enough to risk liability for our GDPR advice.</p>
<p>But in the interests of being helpful to our customers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>ICO - As with previous data protection legislation, if they're doing more than processing their own data for staff administration, then they need to be&nbsp;<a href="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/display/BLUEB/GDPR+-+ICO">registered with the ICO</a>.<br><br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Registry - Internally, the customer will need to hold a registry of the processing of personal data.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The customer controls and processes data for the purpose of their business,&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;Blueberry. Blueberry provides software to the customer. Blueberry’s processing is in Software Development and in IT Systems Support, and sometime in Server Hosting. Blueberry’s processing is&nbsp;<strong><u>not</u></strong>&nbsp;Customer Relations Management, Health Advice, or whatever else the customer’s business is. Blueberry&nbsp;<strong><u>must&nbsp;not</u></strong>&nbsp;sign contracts that claim Blueberry is performing the customer’s business processing.</p>
<p>Personal data is any data associated with an identifiable person. If they’re recording names or email addresses then they’re processing “personal data”.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Internally to Blueberry, I’ve been developing some&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1woXMwGdkkETVtMbHrQzQxvfyZaVnko5iYUgjbbu1-i4/edit?usp=sharing">forms</a>.&nbsp;<strong>Do not edit this form template.&nbsp;</strong>The forms were developed to help us gather data on Blueberry’s own processing. People are using them and not finding them too awful. They don’t cover all the possibilities yet, but you can use it to give advice on how long the process might take.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Lawful bases - The customer will need to identify the&nbsp;<a href="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/display/BLUEB/GDPR+-+Lawful+Basis+of+Activity">lawful basis&nbsp;</a>of that processing.<br><br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Follow-up - Depending on the lawful basis identified, they’ll need some follow-up action. For example:<br><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Basis “consent” – they’ll need to check their consent is opt-in not opt-out. They will need to keep records of who consented to&nbsp;<strong><u>exactly</u></strong>&nbsp;what, and when.&nbsp;<a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/lawful-basis-for-processing/consent/">They’ll need to review a lot of their consent process to check for compliance</a>.</li>
      <li>Basis “contract” – easy; they just need to keep a record of the contract. Sometimes this will be a&nbsp;<a href="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/display/BLUEB/GDPR+-+Processor-Controller+Contracts">processor-controller contract</a>.</li>
      <li>Basis “legitimate interest” – fairly easy – a very short legitimate interests assessment needs to be kept. I've built that into the forms referenced above.</li>
      <li>Basis "public task" - We've seen a few where the Department of Health legally obligates the customer to hold records.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Retention policy - They need to have a clear data retention policy and they should hold data for the minimum possible time.<br><br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Privacy notice - They need to be&nbsp;<a href="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/display/BLUEB/GDPR+-+Privacy+Notice">exactingly clear</a>&nbsp;with the subjects of the personal data about what processing is occurring.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Risk assessment - They need to perform a&nbsp;<a href="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/display/BLUEB/GDPR+-+Short+Risk+Assessment">short risk assessment</a>&nbsp;for each identified process in their registry. And if it comes back negative, then they need to do a more expensive&nbsp;<a href="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/display/BLUEB/GDPR+-+Data+Protection+Impact+Assessment">Data Protection Impact Assessment</a>&nbsp;requiring a record of a consultation with stakeholders.<br><br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>DPO? - If they’re a public authority, or doing large-scale regular and systematic monitoring of data subjects, or working with large-scale&nbsp;<a href="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/display/BLUEB/GDPR+-+Sensitive+or+Highly+Personal+Data">special category data</a>, then they need to appoint a Data Protection Officer.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Contract with Blueberry? - If we’re supporting them and viewing live data, they should be asking for a&nbsp;<a href="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/display/BLUEB/GDPR+-+Processor-Controller+Contracts">processor-controller contract</a>&nbsp;. There's a template at the link.&nbsp;If it’s not happening “occasionally” then we should be seeking the contract to protect ourselves. But, on the other hand, if we’re allowing offshore developers to see the data, then all the processes to get to a proper place are currently bad.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Think about rights - They may be wise to consider how they’d cope with someone exercising a right to erasure, a right to correction, a right to know what’s being held, a right to export, or a right to object to the processing. Not all lawful bases give all those rights.</li>
</ul>
