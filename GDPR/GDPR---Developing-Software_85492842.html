<h1>Customers asking for advice</h1>
<p>This article is for Project Managers fielding general questions about the GDPR from customers where the customer is asking about their own processing.</p>
<p><strong>Note well:</strong>&nbsp;Do&nbsp;<strong><u>not&nbsp;</u></strong>present our advice as expert.&nbsp;We are not yet expert enough to risk liability for our GDPR advice.</p>
<p>But in the interests of being helpful to our customers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>ICO - As with previous data protection legislation, if they're doing more than processing their own data for staff administration, then they need to be&nbsp;<a href="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/display/BLUEB/GDPR+-+ICO">registered with the ICO</a>.<br><br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Registry - Internally, the customer will need to hold a registry of the processing of personal data.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The customer controls and processes data for the purpose of their business,&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;Blueberry. Blueberry provides software to the customer. Blueberry’s processing is in Software Development and in IT Systems Support, and sometime in Server Hosting. Blueberry’s processing is&nbsp;<strong><u>not</u></strong>&nbsp;Customer Relations Management, Health Advice, or whatever else the customer’s business is. Blueberry&nbsp;<strong><u>must&nbsp;not</u></strong>&nbsp;sign contracts that claim Blueberry is performing the customer’s business processing.</p>
<p>Personal data is any data associated with an identifiable person. If they’re recording names or email addresses then they’re processing “personal data”.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Internally to Blueberry, I’ve been developing some&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1woXMwGdkkETVtMbHrQzQxvfyZaVnko5iYUgjbbu1-i4/edit?usp=sharing">forms</a>.&nbsp;<strong>Do not edit this form template.&nbsp;</strong>The forms were developed to help us gather data on Blueberry’s own processing. People are using them and not finding them too awful. They don’t cover all the possibilities yet, but you can use it to give advice on how long the process might take.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Lawful bases - The customer will need to identify the&nbsp;<a href="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/display/BLUEB/GDPR+-+Lawful+Basis+of+Activity">lawful basis&nbsp;</a>of that processing.<br><br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Follow-up - Depending on the lawful basis identified, they’ll need some follow-up action. For example:<br><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Basis “consent” – they’ll need to check their consent is opt-in not opt-out. They will need to keep records of who consented to&nbsp;<strong><u>exactly</u></strong>&nbsp;what, and when.&nbsp;<a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/lawful-basis-for-processing/consent/">They’ll need to review a lot of their consent process to check for compliance</a>.</li>
      <li>Basis “contract” – easy; they just need to keep a record of the contract. Sometimes this will be a&nbsp;<a href="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/display/BLUEB/GDPR+-+Processor-Controller+Contracts">processor-controller contract</a>.</li>
      <li>Basis “legitimate interest” – fairly easy – a very short legitimate interests assessment needs to be kept. I've built that into the forms referenced above.</li>
      <li>Basis "public task" - We've seen a few where the Department of Health legally obligates the customer to hold records.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Retention policy - They need to have a clear data retention policy and they should hold data for the minimum possible time.<br><br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Privacy notice - They need to be&nbsp;<a href="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/display/BLUEB/GDPR+-+Privacy+Notice">exactingly clear</a>&nbsp;with the subjects of the personal data about what processing is occurring.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Risk assessment - They need to perform a&nbsp;<a href="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/display/BLUEB/GDPR+-+Short+Risk+Assessment">short risk assessment</a>&nbsp;for each identified process in their registry. And if it comes back negative, then they need to do a more expensive&nbsp;<a href="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/display/BLUEB/GDPR+-+Data+Protection+Impact+Assessment">Data Protection Impact Assessment</a>&nbsp;requiring a record of a consultation with stakeholders.<br><br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>DPO? - If they’re a public authority, or doing large-scale regular and systematic monitoring of data subjects, or working with large-scale&nbsp;<a href="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/display/BLUEB/GDPR+-+Sensitive+or+Highly+Personal+Data">special category data</a>, then they need to appoint a Data Protection Officer.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Contract with Blueberry? - If we’re supporting them and viewing live data, they should be asking for a&nbsp;<a href="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/display/BLUEB/GDPR+-+Processor-Controller+Contracts">processor-controller contract</a>&nbsp;. There's a template at the link.&nbsp;If it’s not happening “occasionally” then we should be seeking the contract to protect ourselves. But, on the other hand, if we’re allowing offshore developers to see the data, then all the processes to get to a proper place are currently bad.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Think about rights - They may be wise to consider how they’d cope with someone exercising a right to erasure, a right to correction, a right to know what’s being held, a right to export, or a right to object to the processing. Not all lawful bases give all those rights.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Handling Data</h1>
<p>Project managers who are processing unanonymised personal data need to be aware of the following.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>By receiving the data Blueberry counts as processing it. That includes receiving a file, receiving a database, remote login to see the data on a customer's system, or even viewing the data across the internet in a web browser.</li>
  <li>"Personal" data means "any information relating to an identifiable person". Even if the data was received in a commercial context it remains personal data.</li>
  <li>Blueberry shouldn't be in the business of processing personal data for customers except for: database analysis, trouble-shooting, hosting it on a server, anonymising / pseudonymising. Pseudonymising means that the personal data is currently not relatable to an identifiable person, but with the addition of a little more data their identity could be recovered. We might prefer to give the customer tools to anonymise / pseudonymise rather than perform that processing ourselves.</li>
  <li>Customers&nbsp;<i>should</i>&nbsp;send Blueberry a&nbsp;<a href="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/display/BLUEB/GDPR+-+Processor-Controller+Contracts">contract</a>&nbsp;for that processing. Contracts should be recorded on the Project Documents tab in PTS.</li>
  <li>Blueberry doesn't seem to have a legal duty to remind customers that they should send such a contract.</li>
  <li>We should only process based on the written instructions of the customer. Typically the contract, but an email may suffice.&nbsp;If the instructions are for&nbsp;<i>ongoing</i>&nbsp;processing, then we really ought to have it in a contract.</li>
  <li>We should not send personal data to our offshore staff.</li>
  <li>We must not use a sub-processor organisation without the prior written authorisation of the customer.</li>
  <li>When asked, we must co-operate with supervisory authorities (such as the UK's Information Commissioner's Office)</li>
  <li>We need to ensure the security of the processing<ul>
      <li>Staff training<ul>
          <li>Make sure everyone who works with the personal data has read&nbsp;<a href="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/display/BLUEB/GDPR+-+Information+Security+Policy">GDPR - Information Security Policy</a></li>
          <li>Make sure the PMs know what to do&nbsp;<a href="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/display/BLUEB/GDPR+-+When+things+go+wrong">when something has gone wrong</a></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Physical security -&nbsp;<a href="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/display/BLUEB/Details+of+Physical+Security+at+Blueberry">Details of Physical Security at Blueberry</a></li>
      <li>System security – the security of your network and information systems</li>
      <li>Data security –<ul>
          <li>Access controls (do only your team and sysadmins have access?),</li>
          <li>Authentication (is it really the right person logging in?),</li>
          <li>Audit (can you see what has been done?)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Online security – the security of the hosting services, logging services, mail services, etc.&nbsp;You may find some of the answers at&nbsp;<a href="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/display/BLUEB/GDPR+-+What+customers+have+asked">GDPR - What customers have asked</a>&nbsp;helpful for determining what security we typically use.</li>
      <li>Device security –<ul>
          <li>Bring-your-own-Device policies,</li>
          <li>Encryption</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Of the many things that most processors would have to ensure, only a few are typically applicable to Blueberry's cases. Each of these are "where reasonable bearing in mind the costs". If you're doing something other than database analysis, troubleshooting, or anonymisation on personal data, then please see Article 32 / ask Duncan. Below, the ones that we're typically required to ensure:<ul>
      <li>confidentiality</li>
      <li>encryption</li>
      <li>pseudonymisation or anonymisation</li>
      <li><i><strong>if ongoing: a process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating security</strong></i></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>We must keep records of its processing activities (we will have a processing register for this, separate from the asset register)</li>
  <li>We must notify any personal data breaches to the customer, without undue delay. That includes, but isn't limited to the following. Feel free to check with Duncan if you don't know whether a breach should be reported:<ul>
      <li>access by an unauthorised third party;</li>
      <li>sending personal data to an incorrect recipient;</li>
      <li>computing devices containing personal data being lost or stolen;</li>
      <li>alteration of personal data without permission; and</li>
      <li>loss of availability of personal data.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Ask Duncan to fill in more detailed advice if/when the UK is outside the European Union</li>
</ul>
<h1>Process for Accepting Data</h1>
<p>If the data contains any personal data, you&nbsp;<strong>must&nbsp;</strong>treat the data carefully. Most databases will contain names and/or some email addresses that reveal names - that is sufficient to classify the data as personal.</p>
<p>You&nbsp;<strong>must</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://goo.gl/forms/PSLvrpaHhW7rcd6z2">fill in a registry form</a></p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/display/BLUEB/GDPR+-+Processor-Controller+Contracts">Be aware of the legal requirements.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/display/BLUEB/GDPR+-+Handling+Data">Be aware of your responsibilities.</a></p>
<p>We should (a) hold it encrypted (b) have a plan on when it gets deleted.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
