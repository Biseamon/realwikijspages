<h1>GDPR - Process-Controller Contracts</h1>
<p>Largely, no Blueberry company should be in the business of processing personal data for another controller. Rather, Blueberry Systems and Blueberry Consultants build software that assist our customers in processing their own data.&nbsp;<i>But </i>they&nbsp;will have <i>some</i> incidental processing of personal data for another controller during, e.g. database analysis, trouble-shooting / debugging, or pseudonymisation / anonymisation work.</p>
<p>All Blueberry companies process data for their own purposes, but that doesn't require a contract.</p>
<p>Eventually, the Information Commissioner's Office will start pushing for contracts to be standardised, and/or for contracts to be certified by some separate organisation. But those standards and structures do not yet exist.</p>
<p>Below is a template contract that you can use for Software Development and IT Systems Support processing. It must not be used for server hosting. It must not be used when we're sending unanonymised personal data overseas. Please do replace Blueberry Consultants Ltd with Blueberry Systems Ltd where appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>You’ll also need to fill in a </strong><a href="https://goo.gl/forms/PSLvrpaHhW7rcd6z2"><strong>Registry Form</strong></a><strong> for Blueberry’s own records. And when we’ve got a signed contract you’ll need to attach it to your PTS project.</strong> There’s a new tab: “Processor-Controller Contracts” for that.</p>

<p>Document<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More generally, the GDPR requires processor-controller contracts to contain the following information:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Purpose of the processing, e.g. staff administration</li>
  <li>The expected duration of the processing</li>
  <li>Categories of data: See the green box on&nbsp;<a href="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/display/BLUEB/GDPR+-+Privacy+Notice">GDPR - Privacy Notice</a></li>
  <li>Categories of data subjects: e.g. employees</li>
</ul>
<p>And it requires the following terms:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The processor will only act on the written instructions of the controller (unless required by law to act without such instructions);</li>
  <li>The processor will ensure that people processing the data are subject to a duty of confidence;</li>
  <li>The processor will take appropriate measures to ensure the security of processing;</li>
  <li>The processor will only engage a sub-processor with the prior consent of the data controller and a written contract;</li>
  <li>The processor will assist the data controller in providing subject access and allowing data subjects to exercise their rights under the GDPR;</li>
  <li>The processor will assist the data controller in meeting its GDPR obligations in relation to the security of processing, the notification of personal data breaches and data protection impact assessments;</li>
  <li>The processor will delete or return all personal data to the controller as requested at the end of the contract; and</li>
  <li>The processor will submit to audits and inspections, provide the controller with whatever information it needs to ensure that they are both meeting their Article 28 obligations, and tell the controller immediately if it is asked to do something infringing the GDPR or other data protection law of the EU or a member state.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>International Transfers</strong></p>
  <p>Under such a contract, we cannot <strong>easily</strong> have non-EEA staff doing the processing. <strong>Reminder: </strong>processing includes "looking at". Please read the article on <a href="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/display/BLUEB/GDPR+-+International+Transfers">International Transfers</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>GDPR - Process for Accepting Data</h1>
<p>If the data contains any personal data, you <strong>must </strong>treat the data carefully. Most databases will contain names and/or some email addresses that reveal names - that is sufficient to classify the data as personal.</p>
<p>You <strong>must</strong> <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/PSLvrpaHhW7rcd6z2">fill in a registry form</a></p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/display/BLUEB/GDPR+-+Processor-Controller+Contracts">Be aware of the legal requirements.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/display/BLUEB/GDPR+-+Handling+Data">Be aware of your responsibilities.</a></p>
<p>We should (a) hold it encrypted (b) have a plan on when it gets deleted.&nbsp;</p>
<h1><br>GDPR - How To Handle Customer's Data</h1>
<p>Project managers who are processing unanonymised personal data need to be aware of the following.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>By receiving the data Blueberry counts as processing it. That includes receiving a file, receiving a database, remote login to see the data on a customer's system, or even viewing the data across the internet in a web browser.</li>
  <li>"Personal" data means "any information relating to an identifiable person". Even if the data was received in a commercial context it remains personal data.</li>
  <li>Blueberry shouldn't be in the business of processing personal data for customers except for: database analysis, trouble-shooting, hosting it on a server, anonymising / pseudonymising. Pseudonymising means that the personal data is currently not relatable to an identifiable person, but with the addition of a little more data their identity could be recovered. We might prefer to give the customer tools to anonymise / pseudonymise rather than perform that processing ourselves.</li>
  <li>Customers <i>should</i> send Blueberry a <a href="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/display/BLUEB/GDPR+-+Processor-Controller+Contracts">contract</a> for that processing. Contracts should be recorded on the Project Documents tab in PTS.</li>
  <li>Blueberry doesn't seem to have a legal duty to remind customers that they should send such a contract.</li>
  <li>We should only process based on the written instructions of the customer. Typically the contract, but an email may suffice.&nbsp;If the instructions are for <i>ongoing</i> processing, then we really ought to have it in a contract.</li>
  <li>We should not send personal data to our offshore staff.</li>
  <li>We must not use a sub-processor organisation without the prior written authorisation of the customer.</li>
  <li>When asked, we must co-operate with supervisory authorities (such as the UK's Information Commissioner's Office)</li>
  <li>We need to ensure the security of the processing<ul>
      <li>Staff training<ul>
          <li>Make sure everyone who works with the personal data has read&nbsp;<a href="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/display/BLUEB/GDPR+-+Information+Security+Policy">GDPR - Information Security Policy</a></li>
          <li>Make sure the PMs know what to do <a href="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/display/BLUEB/GDPR+-+When+things+go+wrong">when something has gone wrong</a></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Physical security -&nbsp;<a href="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/display/BLUEB/Details+of+Physical+Security+at+Blueberry">Details of Physical Security at Blueberry</a></li>
      <li>System security – the security of your network and information systems</li>
      <li>Data security –<ul>
          <li>Access controls (do only your team and sysadmins have access?),</li>
          <li>Authentication (is it really the right person logging in?),</li>
          <li>Audit (can you see what has been done?)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Online security – the security of the hosting services, logging services, mail services, etc.&nbsp;You may find some of the answers at&nbsp;<a href="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/display/BLUEB/GDPR+-+What+customers+have+asked">GDPR - What customers have asked</a> helpful for determining what security we typically use.</li>
      <li>Device security –<ul>
          <li>Bring-your-own-Device policies,</li>
          <li>Encryption</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Of the many things that most processors would have to ensure, only a few are typically applicable to Blueberry's cases. Each of these are "where reasonable bearing in mind the costs". If you're doing something other than database analysis, troubleshooting, or anonymisation on personal data, then please see Article 32 / ask Duncan. Below, the ones that we're typically required to ensure:<ul>
      <li>confidentiality</li>
      <li>encryption</li>
      <li>pseudonymisation or anonymisation</li>
      <li><i><strong>if ongoing: a process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating security</strong></i></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>We must keep records of its processing activities (we will have a processing register for this, separate from the asset register)</li>
  <li>We must notify any personal data breaches to the customer, without undue delay. That includes, but isn't limited to the following. Feel free to check with Duncan if you don't know whether a breach should be reported:<ul>
      <li>access by an unauthorised third party;</li>
      <li>sending personal data to an incorrect recipient;</li>
      <li>computing devices containing personal data being lost or stolen;</li>
      <li>alteration of personal data without permission; and</li>
      <li>loss of availability of personal data.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Ask Duncan to fill in more detailed advice if/when the UK is outside the European Union</li>
</ul>

  <p><strong>Thoughts</strong></p>
  <p>How do we verify our network security?</p>
  <p>Device security - need to follow-up on BitLocker. Probably ought to discuss BYOD.</p>

  <p>"Blueberry doesn't seem to have a legal duty to remind customers that they should have such a contract." - And we might want to wait until we've resolved a few of the early enquiries before we approach customers so that we have a good process in place.</p>
  <p>"We should not send personal data to our offshore staff without following the additional processes for&nbsp;<a href="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=BLUEB&amp;title=GDPR+-+Assessing+the+Adequacy+of+International+Data+Transfers"><u>international transfer</u></a>." - Which will scare the customer. Martin is developing a technical solution as an alternative.</p>

  <p>MG:&nbsp; We are working on improving our network security - we should have a company-wide VPN in place in the next month or so, and we're creating a system of company-wide groups managed in PTS.</p>
