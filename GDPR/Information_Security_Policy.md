# Information Security Policy

## Objectives 

The objectives of the Information Security Policy are to preserve:

- **Confidentiality** - Access to data shall be confined to those with appropriate authority. 
- **Integrity** – Information shall be complete and accurate.  
- **Availability** - Information shall be delivered to the right person at the time when it is needed.

The aim of this policy is to:

- Introduce a consistent approach to security.
- Explain how the principals of security will be implemented within the Blueberry Group.
- Ensure that all members of staff comply with legislation, and understand their responsibilities.
- Maintain a level of awareness towards Information Security as part of day to day business.
- Protect information assets.


## Responsibilities for Information Security

Ultimate responsibility for information security rests with the Managing Directors, Martin Green of Blueberry Consultants and Blueberry Software, and David Lee of Blueberry Systems. 

Human Resources is responsible for ensuring that workers are aware of their personal responsibilities for information security, and how to access advice on information security matters.

Line managers are responsible for ensuring that their workers are aware of how the policies must be applied within their projects.



“Workers” must be understood to include not only permanent staff, but also temporary staff and contractors.

All workers shall comply with information security procedures. Failure to do so may result in disciplinary action. Each worker shall be responsible for the operational security of the information systems they use.

No person will be allowed access to information systems  without a contract requiring compliance with the security policy.



## Legislation

All workers are individually responsible for complying with the policies. Failure to comply with the policies may be treated as negligence or misconduct. Failure to comply with the policies may lead to disciplinary action or, in the case of gross misconduct, termination of employment.



## Information Security Awareness Training

Information security awareness training shall be included in the staff induction process provided through internal online documentation. An ongoing awareness programme shall be established, with a requirement of refreshing training annually.

 

## Contracts of Employment

Staff security requirements shall be addressed at the recruitment stage. Terms and Conditions of working with Blueberry contain a confidentiality clause. Documentation of expectations of workers will include expectations with regards to information security.

 

## Security Control of Assets

Each data asset shall have a named custodian who shall be responsible for the information security of that asset. 



## Access Controls

Access to information shall be restricted to authorised users who have a bona-fide business need to access the information.



## Physical Security

Offices are required to be protected by security access codes on external and internal doors. An alarm system is to be activated when the offices are closed. Offices are required to use CCTV outside of office hours.

Laptops left in the office are to be secured using locking cables.



## Information Security Events 

All information security events are to be reported and logged.. All information security events shall be investigated to establish their cause and impacts with a view to avoiding similar events.



## Protection from Malicious Software

Blueberry Group uses software countermeasures and management procedures to protect itself against the threat of malicious software. All workers are expected to co-operate fully with this policy.

> Duncan to acquire or create information security awareness training. To be included in staff induction, and ongoing awareness. We have acquired access to the NHS security awareness training, and we'll be rolling that out in August 2020.

> Physical Security - Outside the Office

# Details of Physical Security at Blueberry

## Birmingham Office

During office hours, there is a permanent presence on reception.  Security access codes are required to access other external doors, internal doors from the lift and stairwells, and the door to Blueberry's offices.

When the offices are closed, external CCTV is in operation and monitored by an on-site resident or dedicated security staff provided by The Bond.  In addition, internal cameras trigger notification to a Blueberry team. The site gate and reception door can only be opened by use of a security fob; access control is provided by The Bond. All external doors are alarmed. Laser monitoring is provided along the less trafficked perimeter.

Kensington cables are used to secure computers against unauthorised removal. An office safe is used by staff for IT equipment storage. 



## Stonehouse Office

Blueberry is the sole tenant of the building, there is no shared access. Security access codes are required to access external and internal doors. External doors and windows require a physical key.

When the offices are closed, a fob-operated alarm system is activated. CCTV is being implemented within the first few weeks of moving into the office, this will be similar to Digbeth's in that it will use motion detection and when triggered will email attached images and a pre-formatted message to a mailing list.

Kensington cables are used to secure computers against unauthorised removal.

> How are visitors supervised?
> How do we dispose of any paper and electronic waste?
> 
> MG: Some shredding, some physical destruction of hard disks
> DL: Sensitive paper waste is shredded. Hard disks dismantled.
> Luba: Considering policy
> It's unclear how thoroughly BitLocker is being used in the offices. Arguably, we should enforce a policy of only allowing personal data to be in a home office if the disk is BitLocker protected.
