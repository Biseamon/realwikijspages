# Short Risk Assessment

Every identified activity in the processing register needs a short risk assessment, and a documented decision on whether the activity is high risk or not.

Only if the risk assessment says there is a "high risk" should we perform and document a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA). We assess for ourselves whether those risks are high. The DPIA is a more expensive process because it requires record of a consultation with stakeholders.

There is a set of EU Working Party advice for determining whether an activity is high risk. Alternatively, we can rely on our own interpretation of the law. Pragmatically, I think our own interpretation is the better choice for internal use. 

The Working Party seem to have tried to avoid the complex language of the law and have ended up with a set of criteria that is too lax in some places and too strict in many other places. Notably the Working Party seem to have extended their interpretation on the clause on systematic monitoring on the large scale in public spaces to include both the small scale and non-public spaces.

However, if we're advising consultancy customers, we may want to direct them to the EU Working Party documents.



Below, you will find two sections: Duncan's recommended criteria and the Working Party criteria.



> **Duncan's Criteria**
> 
> -Information here is drawn from https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-91/ and https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/accountability-and-governance/data-protection-impact-assessments/ . In the second link, the ICO adds some criteria.
> 
> We should first ask: Is there a reason to believe there's a high risk to data subjects' rights and fundamental EU freedoms? If so, then a DPIA is needed.
> 
> Otherwise, a data protection impact assessment should be made where personal data are processed AND one of the following criteria is present:
> 
> - If precautions failed, and the data was accessed by an outside party, there would be risk to the data subjects' physical health or safety
> 
> - There is large-scale processing of personal data (e.g. a non-trivial proportion of the UK population)
> 
> - There is use of special category data. (GDPR - Sensitive or Highly Personal Data)
> 
> - There is use of biometric data or genetic data, at all
> 
> - There is decision-making based on *extensive* evaluation of personal aspects
> 
> - There is decision-making without human involvement.
> 
> - There are children data subjects, marketing to children, or provision of online services to children
> 
> - The processing contains any integration of multiple data sets that would *surprise* the data subjects
> 
> - The data subjects' location and behaviour are tracked at an individual level
>
> - There is use of technology that is so new that regulation may not yet have caught-up to its implications.

> **The Working Party Criteria**
> 
> Information here is drawn from http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/document.cfm?doc_id=47711 , the EU Working Party providing advice on the new laws.
> 
> We should first ask: Is there a reason to believe there's a high risk to data subjects' rights and fundamental EU freedoms? If so, then a DPIA is needed.
> 
> Otherwise, the Working Party advice is that a DPIA will typically be needed if an activity hits 2 or more criteria from the list below. 
> 
> A data protection impact assessment should be made where personal data are processed AND:
> 
> - Evaluation, scoring, profiling, or predicting of people
> 	- Includes work performance
> - Automated decision-making with legal or significant effect on people
> 	- E.g. credit screening or government projects
> - Systematic monitoring of people
> 	- The key concern appears to be lack of subject awareness and therefore rights
> 	 - The initial law seems to be speaking of CCTV, but the Working Party includes monitoring of employees work stations, internet access
> - GDPR - Sensitive or Highly Personal Data
> - Large scale processing of personal data
> 	- E.g. a non-trivial proportion of a population
> - Combines data sets of personal data
> 	- Are we integrating systems that the subjects would be surprised by
> - Vulnerable subjects
> 	- Includes: employees, children, the elderly, patients, asylum seekers, and anywhere there is an imbalance of power (e.g. government projects)
> - Innovation
> 	- If the activity is something that the governmental supervisory authority hasn't seen before
> - Prevents subjects' access to a service
> 	- E.g. credit reference screening
