# International Transfers

> **Note well**: We cannot **easily** have non-EEA staff doing processing. **Reminder**: processing includes "looking at". The EU does not want their laws circumvented by moving the processing to a country with weaker laws. If we delegate processing to off-shore staff not covered by one of the items below, then to maintain GDPR-compliance, we would have to notify the activity as a low-risk breach to our customer. And to remain GDPR-compliant, our customer need to say, "no, country X does not afford the necessary legal framework to protect the data subjects rights" and stop the processing.

There are [EU agreements](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-countries_en) in place to allow transfers to countries that have laws that are sufficiently strong. Personal data can flow from the EU (and Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland) to Andorra, Argentina, Canada (commercial organisations), Faroe Islands, Guernsey, Israel, Isle of Man, Jersey, New Zealand, Switzerland, Uruguay and the US (limited to the Privacy Shield framework). Adequacy talks are ongoing with Japan and South Korea.

For everywhere else, another solution is needed. Possible solutions :

- **Not awful solution**: It appears that there's an exemption that we may ***sometimes*** be able to use. We should record the exemption in our processing registry where we describe international transfer as, for instance: “This transfer is processing in performance of a contract that is in the interest of the data subject. The transfer is targeted and proportionate. The contract is between <x> and <y>.”. Anything you can add to that to explain why you’re happy saying that could potentially be useful in the future, but don’t spend more than 15 minutes working on phrasing. This would appear to exempt us from detailing international transfer to contract partners, **but it does not exempt us from informing the data subjects with a privacy notice.**
- **Bad solution**: Use the GDPR Model contracts or EU standard contractual clauses with the developers. These are intended to be used with organisations, not individual people. Nevertheless, the UK's Information Commissioner's Office has green-lit them being used with individuals. However, they essentially put the developer on the hook for legal action if Blueberry fouled up and then closed down. It's not the sort of responsibility that seems appropriate to ask our developers to sign-up to. We could set up a legal entity in the target country to hold liability, but that will often have tax implications. https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en
- **Bad solution**: Use the "Binding Corporate Rules". This is an intensive process suitable for very large multi-nationals, essentially inviting the ICO to come into our offices and decide that Blueberry has suitable processes. It takes years.
