                    <p>Project managers who are processing unanonymised personal data need to be aware of the following. </p><ul><li>By receiving the data Blueberry counts as processing it. That includes receiving a file, receiving a database, remote login to see the data on a customer's system, or even viewing the data across the internet in a web browser.</li><li>&quot;Personal&quot; data means &quot;any information relating to an identifiable person&quot;. Even if the data was received in a commercial context it remains personal data.</li><li>Blueberry shouldn't be in the business of processing personal data for customers except for: database analysis, trouble-shooting, hosting it on a server, anonymising / pseudonymising. Pseudonymising means that the personal data is currently not relatable to an identifiable person, but with the addition of a little more data their identity could be recovered. We might prefer to give the customer tools to anonymise / pseudonymise rather than perform that processing ourselves.</li><li>Customers <em>should</em> send Blueberry a <a href="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/display/BLUEB/GDPR+-+Processor-Controller+Contracts" rel="nofollow">contract</a> for that processing. Contracts should be recorded on the Project Documents tab in PTS.</li><li>Blueberry doesn't seem to have a legal duty to remind customers that they should send such a contract.</li><li>We should only process based on the written instructions of the customer. Typically the contract, but an email may suffice. If the instructions are for <em>ongoing</em> processing, then we really ought to have it in a contract. </li><li><span style="color: rgb(255,0,0);">We should not send personal data to our offshore staff.</span></li><li>We must not use a sub-processor organisation without the prior written authorisation of the customer.</li><li>When asked, we must co-operate with supervisory authorities (such as the UK's Information Commissioner's Office) </li><li>We need to ensure the security of the processing <ul><li>Staff training <ul><li>Make sure everyone who works with the personal data has read <a href="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/display/BLUEB/GDPR+-+Information+Security+Policy" rel="nofollow">GDPR - Information Security Policy</a></li><li>Make sure the PMs know what to do <a href="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/display/BLUEB/GDPR+-+When+things+go+wrong" rel="nofollow">when something has gone wrong</a></li></ul></li><li>Physical security - <a href="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/display/BLUEB/Details+of+Physical+Security+at+Blueberry" rel="nofollow">Details of Physical Security at Blueberry</a></li><li>System security – the security of your network and information systems</li><li>Data security – <ul><li>Access controls (do only your team and sysadmins have access?), </li><li>Authentication (is it really the right person logging in?), </li><li>Audit (can you see what has been done?)</li></ul></li><li>Online security – the security of the hosting services, logging services, mail services, etc. You may find some of the answers at <a href="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/display/BLUEB/GDPR+-+What+customers+have+asked" rel="nofollow">GDPR - What customers have asked</a> helpful for determining what security we typically use.</li><li>Device security – <ul><li>Bring-your-own-Device policies, </li><li>Encryption</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Of the many things that most processors would have to ensure, only a few are typically applicable to Blueberry's cases. Each of these are &quot;where reasonable bearing in mind the costs&quot;. If you're doing something other than database analysis, troubleshooting, or anonymisation on personal data, then please see Article 32 / ask Duncan. Below, the ones that we're typically required to ensure:<ul><li>confidentiality</li><li>encryption</li><li>pseudonymisation or anonymisation</li><li><em><strong>if ongoing: a process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating security</strong></em></li></ul></li><li>We must keep records of its processing activities (we will have a processing register for this, separate from the asset register)</li><li>We must notify any personal data breaches to the customer, without undue delay. That includes, but isn't limited to the following. Feel free to check with Duncan if you don't know whether a breach should be reported:<ul><li>access by an unauthorised third party;</li><li>sending personal data to an incorrect recipient;</li><li>computing devices containing personal data being lost or stolen; </li><li>alteration of personal data without permission; and</li><li>loss of availability of personal data.</li></ul></li><li>Ask Duncan to fill in more detailed advice if/when the UK is outside the European Union</li></ul><p><br/></p><p class="title"><br/></p><div class="confluence-information-macro confluence-information-macro-information"><span class="aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-info confluence-information-macro-icon"></span><div class="confluence-information-macro-body"><p class="title">Thoughts</p><p>How do we verify our network security?</p><p>Device security - need to follow-up on BitLocker.
