<h3>Ch. 1.2 - Side Bar Icons&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the left-hand side of your page you’ll see 'side bar' icons for the following:</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/4489405/4489409.png"></figure>
<p>These include (descending in order):</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>All Posts:</strong> This is a backlink to the main directory for your content type.</li>
  <li><strong>Preview</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Device preview - view the page as your audience via several devices types.</li>
      <li>Smart preview – choose a contact from the drop-down menu and view your content as if you were them, useful for when utilising smart content.</li>
      <li>Shareable preview – create a preview link that you can share with others.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Optimise:</strong> An important section that helps your content rank within SERP's - explained further below.</li>
  <li><strong>Edit Modules:</strong> An alternative way to edit your content rather than clicking within the module itself - explained further below.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note when editing email content some additional icons will also appear, but these are explained further within <a href="Ch.-7---Emails_12583058.html">chapter 7</a> for emails.</p>
<p><strong>Optimise</strong></p>
<p>To help your content rank within search engine results pages (SERP's), HubSpot's ‘Optimise’ feature will analyse your content for effective keyword dispersal.</p>
<p>To use this feature, simply place your text cursor into the entry bar and submit your chosen terms (from targeted keyword research), or you can choose from a list of previously used keywords by searching through the suggestions list. However, please try to avoid repeating keywords (if possible), as this can sometimes cause your own content to compete against each other.</p>
<p>Try to use a minimum of two keywords for your content. Once these have been entered a ‘To-Do’ list of four sections will appear (as bulleted below), and each section will be broken down to display where additional keyword information is needed.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Content Body</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Title</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Meta</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Image</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><i>Note, these sections may vary in order depending on the completion rate of your content.</i></p>
<p>By default, incomplete to-do’s will be highlighted in orange to start with, but as your content is progressively entered the to-do’s will change from orange to green. So keep an eye on them while entering your text and amend any issues that crop up.</p>
<p><strong>Edit Modules</strong></p>
<p>The 3D square icon for ‘Edit modules’ provides an alternative way to enter or edit your page's module text (shown below).</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/4489405/4489412.png"></figure>
<p>By clicking on this icon and choosing the module you want to edit, two tabs will appear called ‘Options’ and ‘Styles’ (shown below). Simply click inside the ‘Options’ tab to enter your text, or use the ‘Styles’ &nbsp;tab to adjust your styling rules.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/4489405/4489411.png"></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Ch. 2 - Images&nbsp;</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Ch. 2.1 - Image Searching&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To find an image in HS open the images dashboard and search through the related folder. or enter the name of your image into the search-bar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Ch. 2.2 - Uploading an Image&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before uploading your image have it prepared with the correct file name.</p>
<p>Please note, if you’re uploading an image in preparation for a blog post, make sure the image’s file name includes your <u>primary search term</u> - which counts as your image’s ‘Alt Tag’ within HubSpot optimisation.</p>
<p>To upload a new image look towards the upper-right hand corner of your dashboard (File Manager or from the&nbsp;appropriate image folder) and click the blue button called ‘Upload Files…’, or alternatively, drag the chosen file into the section called ‘Drag files here’ (shown below).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/5767181/5767179.png"></figure>
<p>From here choose your specific image (enter a name if needed) and click open - not necessary if you've used the ‘Drag files here’ option.</p>
<p>To move an image into the correct folder, click the ‘Gear’ icon (below) towards the right-hand side of the image entry, click 'Move' and choose the appropriate folder for your image.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/5767181/5767180.png"></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Ch. 3 - Call-to-Actions&nbsp;</h2>
<p><br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To access ‘Call-to-Actions’ from the dashboard, navigate to Content &gt; Calls-to-Action. Please note, you can also read HS’s own guidance on this subject <a href="http://knowledge.hubspot.com/cta-user-guide-v2/how-to-create-a-call-to-action-cta-in-hubspot"><u>here</u></a>.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/fXLEzpKFbcETh7NK-2S8adoQhLGhFmSGWjp3-VAjbBPNl8TL7CsFMqjGrJS7lKxSeDqjcooaPF2S_nwp9MoxP3PGgoP5S5AlSJT6cCRowR7EbjH61AxRMQl7foPJ5T6uGQVuTkbw77xmEtIi"></figure>
<p>The presented CTA dashboard will display a list of existing CTA’s and accompanying performance results, these results are segmented into the following categories and are shown in the image directly below.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/EXjL9CpfNYFAIln9Kcf2LpLbelyiIrcTIpq9dLoaqC2Lmwbw5eJdQzLKLtsyRqT1_1rzq94UjzEJeHmk908fV2tRxE4xXD81RuPZ-y4AD15JQXh3BYGrSnDybITWFpbbyZY9GG4VMbuXMN6e"></figure>
<p>From left to right these categories denote:</p>
<p><strong>Status</strong>: The ‘zig-zag’ status symbol will show CTA timeline activity.</p>
<p><strong>CTA</strong>: The name and look of the CTA.</p>
<p><strong>Updated</strong>: When the CTA was last updated.</p>
<p><strong>Views</strong>: How many times a visitor has seen it.</p>
<p><strong>Views to Clicks:</strong> The percentage of views to clicks (best measure of performance).</p>
<p><strong>Clicks</strong>: How many times a visitor has clicked it.</p>
<p><strong>Clicks to Submissions:</strong> The percentage of clicks to forms associated with that page.</p>
<p>You can segment the CTA view by clicking on these column headers, but the ‘Views to Clicks’ metric is probably the best measure of CTA performance.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/m2Nm4BzKg-x65jepcVwNLXzqkm9TqHpsZp_u2RyB4diFeiaLTHPPRtqeZxJlUR92eIM5d9E5JZpXjw9KQKYRfDEyDW6MdPd2th_IbibHXuB12UJ5Q1SW03lYP1eQsbR9Tvcc0jspm5ZGMTpd"></figure>
<p>The associated content of these CTA’s can also be viewed by clicking on the icons to the far right-hand side (shown above). These are separated into the categories of Pages, Landing Pages, Emails and Blog Posts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Ch. 3.1 - Creating a Call-to-Action&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To create a new CTA, click the blue button located towards the top-right hand side of the page called ‘Create a CTA’.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/H3I4jp4gJrO1gkbfhHbDkrI23iPMJ0P9TQBPaNT3kjkMly-JzeJKFS9xOYaLYcdWYTjniTQZ6bCwnsj_pAQ0gQ5uHn09tLsxsp9mBc1gdbw_pHQpjM1b6o3Px4VW292PKzjIKIZqrfJSgwFz"></figure>
<p>On the presented pop-up, fill out the following details under the ‘Information’ tab.</p>
<p>For reference, you’ll also see a preview of how your CTA looks during development further down in the pop-up, so keep an eye on this as you complete the following.</p>
<p><strong>Name</strong>: Give your CTA an internal name.</p>
<p><strong>Campaign</strong>: Attach your CTA to a campaign, or create a new campaign with ‘Add new’.</p>
<p><strong>Link to</strong>: Choose to link the CTA to a web address or an existing HS page.</p>
<p><strong>Link URL</strong>: Place a web address here.</p>
<p><strong>Redirect to Page</strong>: Choose an existing HS page here.</p>
<p><strong>Open in new window</strong>: Always tick this.</p>
<p>Fill out the following information under the Design tab.</p>
<p>Choose the type of CTA button you want, Custom or Image.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/5AFJf_OcE2HNMcCBVXgxU4XnJ8BFC-h253jqkCg-EezSj41FcsLu8ZXeTbWWIQEml-UMNCJ79FNx56Nwxqph6x1bwVfMVbjE7FEi3kZCU5JMD4TSegtLIrGXeGNV-KDBOk9XUjcwCHILQhpg"></figure>
<p style="text-align:center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>For a Custom Button:</p>
<p><strong>Style</strong> - choose the CTA’s style.</p>
<p><strong>Background Colour:</strong> Choose the CTA’s colour.</p>
<p><strong>Size:</strong> Have the CTA sized automatically with padding options (recommended), or manually choose the width and height.</p>
<p><strong>Text:</strong> Choose the CTA text.</p>
<p><strong>Create CTA:</strong> Finish the CTA by clicking here.</p>

<p><strong>Alt Text:</strong> Add your alt text.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> For a blog post CTA, include the primary search term here.</p>
<p><strong>Create CTA:</strong> Finish the CTA by clicking here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Ch. 3.2 - Cloning a Call-to-Action&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s much faster to clone a CTA rather than creating a new design, but you must remember to change the text and destination link.</p>
<p>You can clone a CTA from the dashboard by clicking the gear and arrow icon located towards the far right-hand side (shown below), and choosing the ‘Clone’ option.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Fv-NzZ8QDxIrEumFDfkkYn3MNHxefdRlicZ74_64aRDTW5lzYNUuIGC-X7uEWmXZppzc3jvWOMsv5nib0WsOF-irE4mT6OMoGzJK4GjTEroQuq2QBrHbVMRc8rfW8wEccq7qANPFf88YO2If"></figure>
<p>In the presented pop-up and information tab, change the CTA’s ‘Name’, ‘Link to’, and ‘Redirect to page’ options. Next, in the design tab, change the text within the editor to the chosen CTA copy, then finish by clicking the blue button ‘Update CTA’ in the bottom right.</p>
<p>However, keep in mind that the measured success of a CTA is only relevant within the context of the page and where it’s used. As such, reusing a successful CTA across a different page will not guarantee the same level of effectiveness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Ch. 3.3 - Sliding Call-to-Action&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>Create a CTA:</li>
</ol>
<p>Create the call-to-action image you want to ‘slide-in’ at the side of your blog.</p>
<p>Create the call-to-action using the CTA tool (under content), HubSpot recommends 400px by 178 px.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2. Edit the Blog in HTML not Rich Text:</p>
<ol>
  <li>&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>Click the Source code icon in the blog editor.</p>
<p>A box will appear with the blog’s source code.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3. Add “id=last” to the paragraph or header tag:</p>
<p>Locate the point in the blog source code where you would like the CTA to slide in.</p>
<p>Add “id=last” to the paragraph or header tag e.g. &lt;p “id=last”&gt; or &lt;h2 “id=last”&gt;.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Doo7Ng13f5Cx9oqGUmmYQH4Og6Ap8eDAHG101-vCtiPertFaUI1yEbyVBCeAjaGttVN74oCOJ90nzeA5laG7e_HT8Fn8pd5AomsoWJRjgS92dySi1UL3hN6yyzHqwHiTGLGCWUKKbs4--ao9"></figure>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4. Staying in HTML mode (Source Code box), scroll right to the bottom of the text.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5. Open a notepad tool and copy and paste the following code into it:</p>
<p>&lt;div id="slidebox"&gt;&lt;a class="close"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;<u>ADD CTA EMBED CODE HERE</u>&lt;/div&gt;.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6. Go to the call-to-action tool in HubSpot &gt; Click on the Cog next to ‘Details’ and click embed.</p>
<p>Copy the Embed code and paste into your open notepad tool.</p>
<p>Replace the ‘<u>ADD CTA EMBED CODE HERE</u>’ text with the pasted embed code from HubSpot.</p>
<p>Copy the resulting code.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 7. In your blog’s source code, paste the code at the very bottom.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 8. Save and update the page and check if it works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Ch. 4 - Forms&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Created by Stelios Dritsas, last modified on Jun 30, 2016</p>
<p>To create a Form, navigate to the dashboard and click Contacts &gt; Forms. Please note, you can also read HS’s own guidance on this subject <a href="http://knowledge.hubspot.com/landing-page-user-guide-v2/how-to-create-a-form-for-your-landing-page"><u>here</u></a>.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/EEG30BQISSkzKGnjPqae1Tvm_qBX2XQ4yf23DKxmU6OkEhoSx6uDd74DhIg-PlhiNzl2ByBsNP6TqDWwSNc8JU3pKi4yEgQuebBP1FRwZ3n5YEXYYTPw4r-bn2mbaVR1ERdI3OnGpcM-R5ro"></figure>
<p>To create a new Form, click the blue button located towards the top-right hand side of the page called ‘Create new form’.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/hQuGz509JxPTvgXupxxPPmvKkB6K2AqpX7-gGR0fg1nKYTssM7KPcnXSj0XsHRHttk5qLBJmZCYcz1ZDXgXlV6Wb-PWAcWVhpDWXHj-FktjUU7rWgdmfxYHfVY66FE24pfJwGBJV1ALFPmK1"></figure>
<p>A ‘Create new form’ pop-up will now appear asking you to name your form (for internal use), but be as descriptive as possible, and when finished press ‘Create form’. You’ll now be redirected to the ‘Details’ tab of the main form creator. From here, enter actionable text for your ‘Submit Button Text’ (underneath Form Name), then select the ‘Fields’ tab.</p>
<p>Be aware, you can check how your form looks at any time by pressing the ‘Preview’ button located towards top-middle of the page (below).</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/LwOej57fmN9vbjg4D_RFtluuVLdFCSPXyMHtAEqiUWpNzMlV_vJ31URGo-D0Poo-3ou8z734ds_xKSL2k5Ws9-2a7S7eX6sTCJqYXLazhXiS6-7KER6iMfYuFM11OtM9E0Plvm6RW1kaSP10"></figure>
<p>From the ‘Fields’ tab, select the fields you need either by using the search-bar, or by expanding the category’s on the far-left by pressing the arrow button, then dragging and dropping the relevant fields into the ‘Default questions’ section (below). You can also drag a ‘Add separator’ across to give each field a custom header.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/A7BtVwqTTxYRGoH4Jvfdu1VjlmjfgC7jXTIN0MfgMjf81OJbXvI7LEOn7xOqK7nuaDfATLJxZ31cF_ilXoG94ThX2PRKYGUMVSfkvBGmaAaDWSpDAaIXUBR-xJjYDV79YW3_VYfU-cRxXki1"></figure>
<p>To edit the fields in your ‘Default questions’ section (below), click the ‘Edit field options’ (pencil icon) button towards the right-hand side of your questions, and a pop-up named ‘Editing Field for Property’ will open.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/FG-gN8DPugjfj6YgqK2sv46FuV1Q-ODbSOkSKqvb1AU6itFo6_MkWDGf4p7jaZ6ecPoM7DdSA7uDF9KdnPNs54OdYhyXGOiy8V8IvrSgkEGmXDSR191JB6Kx-wSv02vKvqCzF8YoSzgLlGyk"></figure>
<p>From this pop-up, you will have options for the following:</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1.&nbsp;Field Configuration</strong></p>
<p><strong>Make field required:</strong> The form cannot be submitted without the user having completed this field.</p>
<p><strong>Make field hidden: </strong>Hides the field from the user, for internal category setting usage. For example, you could set a hidden ‘persona’ field to support categorisation later on.</p>
<p><strong>Label:</strong> The label used for the form field.</p>
<p><strong>Placeholder:</strong> Text that appears in the field before anything is typed.</p>
<p><strong>Help Text:</strong> Text presented below the field to help the user.</p>
<p><strong>Default Value:</strong> Enters a default value into the value, that unless changed by the user will be submitted with the form.</p>
<p>When finished press ‘Done Editing’.</p>
<p>You can also tag your fields as ‘Smart’ by pressing the star icon (below) to the far-right of your fields.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Uzr82TDN-4wg0kKh-hVe18LNjKOpoWfd3X7FMKoHUULBQn9lqWzcd7ozWJ9Nr2idoeBnYEzFMg7xarn1Mk2MZTqhIppZX3n0WvKf5U9O8BRPiRxDRMBu1yCpp8Pjp3V1NgRQvbefMOp2TVyh"></figure>
<p>Selecting this option will hide this field if the user has previously answered this question or if the property already has a value on their contact record. The email field will always remain visible on the form, but will be pre-populated with the data from previous submissions.</p>
<p>Next, select the ‘Options’ tab, and complete the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Pre-populate fields with known values:</strong> Completes the field if the user has known values on their contact record. It’s better practice to use the Smart Fields feature for this.</li>
  <li><strong>Disable cookie tracking: </strong>When disabled, every submission from the same browser creates a new contact. Be aware, if selected, you cannot use the Smart Fields feature, and page information such as page view history and source data will not be available.</li>
  <li><strong>Display Captcha on this form? </strong>Display a Captcha on this form to prevent automated form submissions.</li>
</ol>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-CXWnUhwaF-ldMpjdeTcVLpq5yqod_ztVYqRbbbxy1-OhQxU6GNUwpA8ssSorXQrm4pMY9n53nrycanzU6kUWURr4H1JIA7SyKG43Ze3Gjx5iJwWiyFMzaPT7nYHMHrco1cPxl3LMhhn-lhb"></figure>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4.<strong> Notified when submitted:</strong> Entered email addresses will be sent a notification when the form is completed.</p>

<h3>Ch. 5.1 - Preparing a Blog Post&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s easier to have a blog post prepared in advance, and then copy it into HS, rather than creating it from scratch within the page editor. However, in order for a blog post to rank in Google, it must contain the following elements to generate organic traffic.</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Keywords</strong>: 1 primary, and 1 secondary search term (do not reuse terms).<br><br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong>Title</strong>: &lt;60 characters with spaces – must include the primary search term.<br><br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong>Subheadings</strong>: Include the primary search term naturally.<br><br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong>Main body text</strong>: &lt;1000 words – use both search terms multiple times.<br><br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong>First Paragraph</strong>: Include the primary search term once naturally – twice if possible.<br><br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong>Meta description</strong>: &lt;21 words - include the primary search term.<br><br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong>Image</strong>: You will need to prepare and upload a relevant image for your blog post, which includes the primary search term within the file name (Alt Tag). For instructions, please refer to <a href="Ch.-2---Images_4489383.html">chapter 2</a>.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong>Call to Action (CTA)</strong>: You will need to prepare a CTA for your blog post. For instructions, please refer to <a href="Ch.-3---Call-to-Actions_12582927.html">chapter 3</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Ch. 5.2 - Saving a Draft&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For reference, to continue editing a blog post at a later time, hit the ‘Save’ button towards the top right-hand corner of the page. Now, the page can be closed without any loss of information.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/8KCrrcX-haKVUGAGDW7VJ2xp9DYSQK5EZupNaMW3uY_Y2iDGIXz8TTqWtxna02BH0wmxzTfLSjTazXfCPLXhc5hz9HuLYWjKAq3pWJalRGGkEBC-EvZYeV0Cl2HGBwpreoiwFY-6QJngqNqj"></figure>
<p>However, to access a draft later on, navigate back to the Blogging dashboard, and look towards the upper left-hand side to a section labelled ‘drafts’. Click through to resume your progress.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/E4i4Dqmgk3FN2XhUWCy79NiGQXk5cppYfRN3B1PEuy1SJvjQuvzLQLjkbCvH4x8ct12cKCsK5pC2lngxA-x06qXmt5k0vsQVeK0MzXxxM3pKBFDSAW3twm_KeJyeBZnnZvilv-l1URTPU7kO"></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Ch. 5.3 - Creating a New Post&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To create a new blog post, open the dashboard page for the Blogging section, and click the blue button called ‘Write new blog post’, located towards the upper right-hand corner.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/bxKQOdYoREaQFfkaX6-0J9khZOrDfF9jxgA-Grs00tyNgV7UiUOp9RfmhOXsA52Q1WYRMO8NScBLsLSswNTQsoo30Z39tr8Q0qb0dOMpXBm8T_niXqkBmHwN9DGPJgQ9CR04ABQVlevLvpBG"></figure>
<p>A pop-up will now appear called ‘How do you want to start your blog post?’ Select the option ‘Blank Post’, and you’ll be presented with the main editor for blog post creation.</p>
<p>However, before you begin there are some areas to take note of:</p>
<p>Firstly, look for the tabs called Edit, Settings, and Publish or Schedule - located towards upper-centre of the main editor page (below).</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/bAyH3RiAXrASxICe0atnqv0pZ00jmAeDN3zBSyTFJsehf8qAKW0e2MZVEqpz7A1vsoj54p8GPjA9dVeGbr0x6zX7Uzer87WhCUFFc4M_-PEllso7-MC-5Q2l35sAsL87lNAYy2SJY5OSoZvT"></figure>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Is the main section to add and edit text.</p>
<p><strong>Settings</strong>: Is the section for ‘post’ information and advanced details.</p>
<p><strong>Publish</strong>: Publish the blog or schedule it for later.</p>
<p>When you’re ready to enter your text, proceed to the <a href="Ch.-5.4---Entering-Blog-Text_12582997.html">chapter 5.4</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Ch. 5.4 - Entering Blog Text&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enter the main text for your blog post under the ‘Edit’ subsection.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/bAyH3RiAXrASxICe0atnqv0pZ00jmAeDN3zBSyTFJsehf8qAKW0e2MZVEqpz7A1vsoj54p8GPjA9dVeGbr0x6zX7Uzer87WhCUFFc4M_-PEllso7-MC-5Q2l35sAsL87lNAYy2SJY5OSoZvT"></figure>
<p>For instructions on how to enter your text, please refer to <a href="Ch.-1---Content-Editor_4489374.html">chapter 1</a> - Content Editor.</p>
<p>To start inserting your main body text, simply click on the slightly greyed out sections with the circular pencil icons, called ‘Title’ and ‘Post Body’ (shown below).</p>
<p>For the ‘Title’ section, simply click on the box shown below.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/FCQAVZAkxJ53G8lOpUEVKx7EDmRv6dPeHuxkStoz759ojPAfjqpwxDMmEJ9sTIATrz_f4Qtvl7GQw5jGAD_lzef6wilskI_emubE0tHFFGgJY-X1ympBB00J4xI-jOh_capt9Gbrvl2hlcNg"></figure>
<p>For the ‘Post Body’ section, simply click on the box shown below.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/J1wnXLt2Z1kq6ZGNfdna-anOQ1_5C11f0Ua0Xtnj7gO4UgTTJrG1eka53OPa4lnBKZo-nfiuXVTo5XF8cJdkQGgYPEXWoVV0ovOTaqrAzc2_4jPPiFfW9Y5537df7ty26wabXISDfeJkONjB"></figure>
<p>Then whilst entering your ‘Post Body’ text, complete these additional actions to optimize the effectiveness of your blog post:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Spacing</strong>: Delete any extra spaces created between paragraphs.<br><br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong>Insert a Read More Separator</strong>: The read more separator tells HubSpot where to stop the preview text within the main blogging webpage (shown below).&nbsp;<br><br><br>To do this, place the text cursor after an opening paragraph (usually the second), then press the ‘insert read more separator’ within the text toolbar (below).<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/9Db2WRsBmCNJdh_ALmfIFERc1BFCQe-dT3UhbjyZn0AFCVYlpabIIbOEpuBBGEyjhMyuUfIf9UAFEqGmcq030krBwYLpWRgzdZ_8TxQOIp9Z97j7BTo4Mq4Jb3vRm8z_Imna06RlcywUf8Ik"></figure>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/nNN3nbBafzMXx8ZmtsydQQx4rnR0StZWo1c1SR5G7LRrFw3LRWpvg7aUMvcd2O-2Os2LgRVfkow7Cu_ByNoD0F3zll_QyCF-wdgi6aRqyAXkrc1n0xAVZ2tYsqB9EZaDJIJuziqgM2oDiWEM"></figure>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Linking</strong>: Every link you include should open within a new window.&nbsp;<br><br>To do this, highlight you chosen text and click the ‘insert/edit link’ button within the text toolbar, add your URL and then tick the ‘open in a new window’ box shown within the pop-up.<br><br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong>Images</strong>: Each blog post should contain at least one image, which needs to be positioned towards the beginning of the article, before the ‘read more separator’.&nbsp;<br><br>Hopefully, you’ve already uploaded an image in advance for you blog post, but just in case you haven’t, please refer back to the ‘Uploading an Image’ section within <a href="Ch.-2.2---Uploadng-an-Image_5767181.html">chapter 2</a>.&nbsp;<br><br>To insert your image, place the text cursor in the desired image location and click the ‘insert/edit image’ button within the text toolbar to open a pop-up. Next, navigate through the ‘Select an image’ pop-up to find your specific image, then insert it using the blue ‘use image’ button towards the bottom left.&nbsp;<br><br>Once inserted, right align the image, and then (depending on its size) change its size to suit the article by double clicking the image and selecting the ‘Edit Image…’ button. Then within the immediate pop-up, reduce the dimensions until the desired fit is achieved. Alternatively, select one of the quick-size options available when double clicking the image.<br><br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong>Call to Actions (CTA’s)</strong>: A single CTA should be used to finish every blog post, to redirect the audience to a relevant CMM page.&nbsp;<br><br>Hopefully, you’ve already uploaded a CTA in advance for you blog post, but just in case you haven’t, please refer back to&nbsp;<a href="Ch.-3.1---Creating-a-Call-to-Action_12582933.html">chapter 3</a>.&nbsp;<br><br>To insert a CTA into your blog post, place the text cursor next to the desired CTA location and click the ‘Insert Call-to-Action’ button (star shaped icon) within the text toolbar. From this location, select the specific CTA needed, and insert it by selecting the blue ‘Insert CTA’ button towards the bottom left.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Ch. 5.5 - Blog Post Settings&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Access the main settings for your blog via the ‘Settings’ subsection:</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/bAyH3RiAXrASxICe0atnqv0pZ00jmAeDN3zBSyTFJsehf8qAKW0e2MZVEqpz7A1vsoj54p8GPjA9dVeGbr0x6zX7Uzer87WhCUFFc4M_-PEllso7-MC-5Q2l35sAsL87lNAYy2SJY5OSoZvT"></figure>
<p style="text-align:center;"><br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under ‘Post Information’, additional info is needed to categorise your blog post within HubSpot and Google. To do this, complete the following sections:</p>
<p><br>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1) Title: </strong>If you have already entered text into the 'Title' module under 'Content', then this section should already be automatically filled. If not, please complete this process.<strong>&nbsp;</strong><br>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2) URL</strong>: The URL is automatically formed around the pre-existing page title found within the main editor. If empty, return to the main editor and insert a title.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3) Author</strong>: Select an author from the drop-down box, or create a new author using the ‘add new’ option above the entry box.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4) Topics</strong>: Your actions here will depend on which blog you're writing for - CMM or BB Consult. For CMM simply choose the topic 'Blogging', but for BB Consult, you’ll need to assign both a ‘Topic’ and a ‘Tag(s)’.</p>
<p><i>'Topics'</i> are for article segmentation, like that for 'How Blueberry Solves' - you can find a full list of these <a href="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/display/MC/Blog+Structure">here</a>. To create a topic, simply click inside the 'Topics' section, type in the name of the topic, then press 'Create new topic'. Or, if your topic already exists, simply choose it from within the drop down menu.</p>
<p><i>'Tags'</i> include subcategories like 'security', 'password handling', and 'ui design' etc. - they form a second layer of segmentation in addition to 'Topics'. However, tags are also created via the ‘Topics’ section, but to make it a ‘Tag’ rather than a 'Topic’ you’ll need to use this format: type in 'Tag: Example', or just click inside the topics box and choose from one of the available options</p>
<p><strong>5) Campaign</strong>: For anything CMM related, just choose the Cloud Machine Manager option. To create a new campaign use the ‘add new’ button to the right-hand side of the entry box, and complete the presented instructions, or choose a pre-existing option.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6) Meta Description</strong>: Insert a prepared meta-description into the entry box. For instructions please refer to <a href="Ch.-5.1---Preparing-a-Blog-Post_12582987.html">chapter 5.1</a>.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;7) Featured Image</strong>: Place an image within the main editor to complete this section. Note: if you’ve been following this guide through then this should already be completed.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;8) Social Publishing</strong>: Create a short message for social media (under 94 characters), which will auto-publish to Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, and include a backlink to the article upon publication.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Ch. 5.6 - Publishing or Scheduling a Blog&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before proceeding to this next section, make sure that all your orange to-do’s’ in optimisation under ‘Edit’ are now green, and that your additional information under ‘Settings’ is also complete.</p>
<p>Publish or schedule your blog post under the third main subsection ‘Publish or Schedule’:</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/bAyH3RiAXrASxICe0atnqv0pZ00jmAeDN3zBSyTFJsehf8qAKW0e2MZVEqpz7A1vsoj54p8GPjA9dVeGbr0x6zX7Uzer87WhCUFFc4M_-PEllso7-MC-5Q2l35sAsL87lNAYy2SJY5OSoZvT"></figure>
<p>Select either the ‘Publish now’ option, to publish the post immediately, with a wait time of up to 15 minutes. Or select the ‘Schedule for later’ option and follow the presented instructions to schedule your message at the desired time.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/DznYaNJ3bfG-t5j5V4ylTv6SPxs9YPjotI1Akxg6aCvb_vYvEa12qRjhgeoQb7IiB33JeQokSyIHaiU45HuzdMjMuM7uNBQk_WnDqXT1qsNGnuiStH7sYBOjtC0soxegLv6ZKUJSnJyo1BhJ"></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Ch. 6 - Social Media&nbsp;</h2>
<p>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To access Social Media from the dashboard, navigate to Social &gt; Inbox. Please note, you can also read HS’s own guidance on this subject <a href="http://knowledge.hubspot.com/social-media-user-guide-v2/how-to-promote-your-content-with-the-social-media-tool"><u>here</u></a>.</p>
<p><br>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6EA3DemBur1Lh1nyUG94ws688e7pnZJdIwULTeVze8yBML4JmXpCzyB0Cwtwb6TDJRgQxX17aj2F9d-FLCfSnHXSa3VW1_QHockiFgTlraRpoR2wbqMWETO5Gg-3BAO7S1-CuUEi8tN2RsfS"></figure>
<p><br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most important links from the main social dashboard are those located to the left-hand side called ‘Inbox’, ‘Monitoring’, and ‘Publishing’. The fourth link for Reports is discussed further in chapter 13.</p>
<p><br>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/yC2-91UwD0dN_CohGSNSubt-sIiQ22q5UHIcNnI5_SzZjsCvSsvVaXgEvHKYwmmjuUyQrhhBr0tPvQbVbi66hXGuMpmfN9w2Xc8xa2Tl-ZECc9r9zDQAdipdByR9Xhk9O-QlbNH1qX_hNifi"></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Ch. 6.1 - Inbox&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Inbox page provides notifications on what new social interactions your accounts have had (like Twitter and Facebook); displayed through both a numeric counter next to the Inbox link, and text updates from the main-feed.</p>
<p>However, the main feed will only display updates from one account at a time. To see what interactions different accounts have had, select the ‘All accounts’ drop-down menu from the right-hand side of the page, and choose your preferred account.</p>
<p>In addition, to change between the types of interactions displayed, select the ‘All item types’ menu (to the right of All accounts), and choose between the new options of Conversations, New followers, and Stream matches.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/of-dEQ2xA9SxmbTOsvxpoRDNofaEF7k9IEyPEBBYeAWcO8Y0BrXbtyjUPr9gJiPr7WRrgJT4LCrXLqs03zzTJpCcSaIVWaJ2Jp8lFbKQAXKaUthXhFf8zpigBVFYEb68XjI69s18xgL-fJLv"></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Ch. 6.2 - Monitoring&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Monitoring page displays what Twitter communications there has been for specific search phrases called ‘Streams’.</p>
<p>Streams are user created and effectively cast a net across Twitter, pulling-in any tweets that contain a particular set of words. Highly useful for monitoring trends and competitors!</p>
<p>You can view an already created Stream either by selecting a named tab like those shown below, or by clicking the ‘More’ option towards the far right-hand side, which shows every stream available.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/hOPCrTk1pR5zOyMemHHPhcBr02sZsMezw6AUffT0ZwxGxujbnpwk6GdlWQWoXbWoW7SsZIKA8POOy0JlM8xVstwZ5SRDX3UPJenzMHMEvhPVHw_6dHQnKdLXZKQeEV8UJl-mCKqby9oczJuv"></figure>
<p>By selecting a stream, it will display what discussions there have been for its terms, allowing you to monitor areas of interest, brand chatter, and competitor activity.</p>
<p>To create a new stream, click the ‘+’ icon next to the previously discussed ‘More’ link, and follow the on-screen instructions. To edit a current stream, select that particular stream and click ‘edit’ (below), then adjust or add new search phases to the ‘that contain’ text box, then save.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/bDAAWnsiDTY3uJvHqzmk4P5QAB_GE0yXzH6lbQrljMquUIFpBLIquxGQ4qPXgnnqt161fIW_at3vkMVfR2F4Y7kpRRFvNVyoGpF4hCwcI_waJrZNCdoQKvk5hKfx952Rh66OEbVRxsXxTcea"></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Ch. 6.3 - Publishing&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The publishing page is useful because it shows how effective previous social updates have been, and allows users to craft better messages as a result.</p>
<p>The main view of the page will show how many clicks and interactions each past update has had. More specifically, clicks indicate (ideally) how many people have clicked the link or image within the message, whilst interactions will include Twitter responses such as retweets, likes, and replies.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/y4DRTDtiG4z8Bg_yV1WeL71YyYd5wgLLXCrNbJv9Qi2wFmFMFWhi9NEmYJr1-PRScKu2G1sXX7zfXnXAe8jaquDqotvjWDU-zy8nPt4g0wCwp0DUv-DJ0xIj3lPT-VGgcSIGwI-52yT-Njj0"></figure>
<p>The filters for this publishing section are very straight forward.</p>
<p>The ‘Published’ and ‘Scheduled’ tabs will simply show what they describe, whilst the ‘Unsuccessful’ tab will display those updates that failed to auto-publish, with an explanation as to why. In more cases this is very rare, but if this happens, simply reschedule the failed message for another time.</p>
<p>In addition, the ‘Filter Channels’ tab lets you segment social updates by different accounts like Facebook and LinkedIn, the ‘All campaigns’ tab segments by HS campaign, and the ‘All time’ tab is by time period.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Ch. 6.4 - Posting a Social Update&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, if a Twitter message is entered, and then another social media icon is selected (via the top), the message will now be carried over into the new channel. Yet, if a duplicated message is then edited, the changes will not subsequently carry back over.</p>
<p>Note: Try not to publish <u>identical</u> social messages across each platform.&nbsp;The exception to this is when publishing a Blog with a social update, as HubSpot only provides a job-lot feature here.</p>
<p>For example, using an image for a Twitter update, reduces a lot of the text characters you can use, but this measure does not affect Facebook and Linkedin posts. Additionally, unlike Twitter and Facebook, LinkedIn does not use hashtags, so make sure not to include them for this channel.&nbsp;It’s most effective to be on the ‘Publishing’ page when posting an update, but this is not essential.&nbsp;To post an update, click on the blue button located towards the top-right hand side of the page called ‘Compose a message’.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/zjrM0DIP-asx11RCVgXYmJxjoDH1_-Hgn3pKKNF58JjVxEvH7Bepr7_rQFgO_TkoVDtnvhG-v9Aa9xaddbCkxZHaNXN9EfyE_ABUjSsRezjrUB7YQqwu3dPrjEAwBbbs_0FPRjHpofyn6Dw9"></figure>
<p>Note: This button is similarly located in the same position for the Social Media pages on Monitoring, Publishing, Reports, and Settings.</p>
<p>A pop-up box will now appear allowing a Twitter message to be entered.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/EAmVanoBULyF1vBbksnG4R_OM2P1O8xQNreyi09IDn5N-bT4I6R8kD_ao35kfyUh5u2LXPRDtvCuPizVd-Qq754HYnZ7vSI7Fm-44CjPORCSHoH6Zevkhh8RHlFXq6dGRp_j_l5lLQ2ku7jm"></figure>
<p>Along the top of this pop-up, there are also additional icons for Facebook, LinkedIn, and Google+. From here you can either compose a message for just one account, or publish it across all of them.</p>
<p>Through this interface you can also insert links, attach images, schedule a message, and attach messages to a certain campaign.</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Links</strong>: Any links entered into a social update are automatically shortened upon publication, allowing HS to track overall clicks, and gage how popular messages are. Prior to publication though, links will always be displayed at their normal length.&nbsp;<br><br>Generally always try to include an actionable link within a social update.&nbsp;<br><br><br>As such, you can either paste-in URL’s from any site (HS site included), or to share a HS specific blog post or landing page, you can use the ‘Attach’ option to select the appropriate CMM link.<br><br>&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/MQRum-JBd8OkcrEqtIaNFWt6O8yQzAwlKKCwkT5M7X75vgPlHfQgHDM7VzWrqdK-QwD7HYyod6utouoWRGFfdhLfcPYOEhanCmya5bG6p1IpMSnODLYhWOdUqUbDWAF_2Pqa7eR8vD8_G8ZJ"></figure>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Images</strong>: If a link has been included within a social message, HubSpot will automatically pull through any relevant images from the destination page and allow them to be attached to the post.<br><br>Alternatively, an image can be uploaded with a social message by selecting ‘Attach’ followed by the ‘Image’ button, and then choosing an image from the File Manager. For instructions, please refer to the ‘Images’ topic.<br><br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong>Scheduling</strong>: To schedule a message or post it immediately, open the ‘Schedule for Today’ link, and follow the on-screen instructions to set the desired time.<br><br><br>&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/nn5zmr7CGVG0WFQbjZWzYw21j407l8twj3RxF1Hh28cNlNpb1_eay9s485YP_5KXvmum068MJMx8fwmSqDttNiK55VvB_iaY-vLKbEUj1va-c77Pu-y5e6305RN393nN1IaLYwIiuNsYCFl6"></figure>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Campaign</strong>: A social message can also be attached to a campaign by opening the ‘Select Campaign’ drop-down menu, and choosing the relevant campaign. If you need to setup a new campaign select the ‘New’ link.</li>
</ol>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/SqV2Bluq8j8_YapFcABvkdqROiDoZCl7QiaEuXzxvLXoahC-KTru-Ut4BJFEZp1aGgyMSWk5JsxZpStFIqHWjUkf6_vr-Mg9XPkSq8ufvMyZXMLDbRqY7TYG_W2vqdXfJa_xrnd0fqc0jQLS"></figure>

<h2>Ch. 7 - Emails&nbsp;</h2>
<p><br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To access Emails from the dashboard, navigate to Content &gt; Email. Note: Please note, you can also read HS’s own guidance on this subject <a href="http://knowledge.hubspot.com/email-user-guide-v2/how-to-create-and-send-emails"><u>here</u></a>.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/wUgjZF98G7oLsTrBfRtFV_p6WHgHrXe4zcF-zANGxqPnwhMSbjyXV_L3MrwPj7TWyxQ_GwAMVAYcObjV0923bLrvwIQx4zL0Dl0udcdhiBR-ok9-lN9Ksly54W6wrjxhjseLAgsMQDoyh3RG"></figure>
<p>The page presented shows recent email performance, and from here you can get a quick snap-shot of how your email campaigns are currently shaping up. To sort your view, use the drop-down menus for All Emails and All Campaigns to filter presented emails, alongside the buttons for Recent and Monthly to change the time period. This page also displays what recent drafts emails have been edited, in addition to any recent email contact churn (a natural part of email marketing).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Ch. 7.1 - Creating an Email&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To create an email, you can either clone an existing email or create a new one from scratch. To clone an email, find your preferred email, pan to the right, find the ‘gear’ icon, click clone from drop-down menu to its right, and enter a new name. Or to create a new email, click the blue button located towards the top right-hand side of the page called ‘Create new email’.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/O6wVZlVRA4uDu-2eLQrT3ZHBMXZbUhcIv1LLF8mrls2IlJ13A6sdpv8Qi-xxqU-gC-IX0ImM_wKombTsb-6UtZjdJxx37OyOeSz2fvaUEmwJD9xwVBZ-KDMQf3QXY4qUbVWJesAeSeRzmpPV"></figure>
<p>The presented page will then ask you to choose a template for your email - look to utilise one with the preferred header and/or footer image, alongside the necessary module layout. For CMM emails I mostly use the template ‘CMM 1 Column Above Body’,&nbsp;but you can preview other designs by hovering over the template and selecting the magnifying glass.</p>
<p>To create a new email template see <a href="Ch.-12.1---Creating-a-Template_12583189.html">chapter 12</a> for instructions.</p>
<p>When you have decided, click on the desired template and enter a name, click create, and you’ll then be presented with the main email editor. From here, take a note of the following email details.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Ch. 7.2 - Email Details&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clicking within the ‘email details’ box (below) will expand it for additional information entry.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/c0BOHg0QN7iumDTXmIMcY3pPjvbw6FxatsRMOwr0zpqa0pep9OZQiKZufkjVv7pk23_ncvSe8hZzE8nup6vJMeEedJ5-X6bfgUxIL51XpNipO6CBSCMXjQDYhtnHz3K0HjkMzUsMJhq9XljW"></figure>
<p><strong>From name:</strong> Use the drop-down menu to enter your sender’s name &gt; add a contact by clicking add/manage.</p>
<p><strong>From email address:</strong> Use the drop-down menu to enter your email address of your sender &gt; add an address by clicking add/manage.</p>
<p><strong>Subject line:</strong> Enter your subject line</p>
<p><strong>Preview text:</strong> Enter your preview text</p>
<p>When preparing this information try to use a real persons ‘from’ name person and email address, as opposed to a pseudo name or ‘team’ message. This makes the message much more personal and engaging, but isn’t always necessary for routine and automated responses that wouldn’t look genuine anyway.</p>
<p>For your subject line, make it attention grabbing but also nice and concise, this is what will make someone open your email. Whilst you preview text can just be an adjusted first sentence from your main email, but edit as necessary. When finished click done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Ch. 7.3 - Left Hand Side Menu&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the left-hand side of the page you will see icons for the following:</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/DoVLbHYEX3mP2SY0K7qu5Upog33Q1wZECnjl-eHZDpC_37J5CSy8Oova-HauwX9AZP1CUM6Ohd8Iw9KUFo57i5fz2LrazCmpRxLOfv3Hl7qPmTJ40lpFVsLSN1kPRk8kCCRGsn7qmhuiHi9W"></figure>
<p>Descending in order:</p>
<p><strong>Preview:</strong> View the page as your audience via several device types</p>
<p><strong>Send test email:</strong> Send a test email to yourself and view how it’s received</p>
<p><strong>Test in email clients:</strong> Test how you email is viewed within a range of email clients</p>
<p><strong>Optimise:</strong> Complete the optimisation sections suggested, but don’t worry about missing CTA’s as they’re not always necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Edit modules:</strong> A different way to enter your email information, you can select between all the different modules of your email and edit or adjust them as necessary.</p>
<p><strong>A/B test:</strong> Create two versions of your email to test what factors engage your audience more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Ch. 7.4 - Main Email Body&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scrolling further down the page you’ll see your email, and all the main editable sections if you hover over them. You should only really need to change the ‘body’ modules which allow you to enter and edit your text, and ideally leave the header and/or footer image alone (which you should’ve completed at the template stage).</p>
<p><strong>HTML</strong></p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/UTMkYLMnOoB1iDpGVln-pMTXfgSNOGFi4eoe1WIDNsi4nxgdSS51n6OL_jhvGINiyOmgVPsta9hKkoLKLmEWyxcm2iO-q6LxPUmgtH7pyFGWmn2Hls-FKx-Q6cmeyuS0ZE79VJxHu1mp71EJ"></figure>
<p>To edit an HTML version, select the HTML tab (as shown above).</p>
<p>To edit a text module, simply click inside the greyed out boxes with the pencil icon, and enter your text. However, if you already have your text prepared within a Word document, make sure to avoid any formatting issues by cleansing it within Windows notepad before implementing it within your email.</p>
<p>Some suggested things you may want to implement within your email are:</p>
<p>Images;</p>
<p>Links:</p>
<p>CTA’s</p>
<p>Personalisation tokens</p>
<p>Source code</p>
<p>For help on how to implement these areas, please refer Content Editor in <a href="Ch.-1---Content-Editor_4489374.html">chapter 1</a>. Then once you’ve completed these steps, press save and proceed to the ‘Settings’ tab.</p>
<p><strong>Plain Text</strong></p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/XXA9CFXPLalfNlFkjxwcyr9kk2ts7h4NjljFFAIr9VeukWQSO8FUNDAwKNfqddOgMBPIJ7gs-m8or3qeUctW1TrfzpMwg9NPhZlLEMtjyMcw5fzu6_u7n-83Iq7D3MAWLaMbpGsxUzEfF9z0"></figure>
<p>To edit a Plain text version, select the Plain text tab (as shown above).</p>
<p>Please note, a plain text copy of your email is always created alongside your HTML version. To edit this copy, click the Plain Text button&nbsp;(show above) above the text box to the top-right, then click edit to make your changes, or revert the text back to its HTML copy by selecting the Reset from HTML button from the same position as the Edit button (below).</p>

<p>Once you’ve completed these steps press save and proceed to the ‘Settings’ tab.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Ch. 7.5 - Settings&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clicking the ‘Settings’ tab towards the top of the page, allows you to enter the following information:</p>
<p><strong>Internal email name:</strong> Enter a name for internal reference (this will not be sent)</p>
<p><strong>Campaign:</strong> Select a campaign or create a new one ‘Add new’</p>
<p><strong>Email type:</strong> Email type is the category your email is sorted under a user’s email preferences, to which they can choose to unsubscribe from.</p>

<p><strong>Web page</strong> <strong>title:</strong> Internal name for organisation</p>
<p>Web page <strong>URL:</strong> Select a domain as appropriate</p>
<p><strong>Meta description:</strong> Add a meta description to drive search engines to your page, but keep it under 160 characters</p>
<p><strong>Web page status:</strong> Choose from one of the three options available</p>
<p><strong>Web version information:</strong> You won’t need to change this</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Ch. 7.6 - Advanced Settings&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the same page as Settings complete the following information:</p>
<p><strong>Template settings:</strong> You should not need to change your template, but you may swap or edit your template from here. Please note, editing your template may also affect other templates already published, so please consider the ramifications before proceeding.</p>
<p><strong>Footer:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Office location:</strong> Use the default office location, or manage/edit the details by selecting the manage button. From here you can make changes or create a new set.</p>
<p><strong>Footer information:</strong> Editing footer information is similar to the emails template, in that any changes made will also carry across to other published emails. So please consider the ramifications before proceeding.</p>
<p>Once you’ve completed these steps, press save and proceed to the ‘Recipients’ tab.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Ch. 7.7 - Recipients&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the Recipients tab (towards the top of the page) you can choose who to send your email to or save your email for automation to be used in workflows.</p>
<p>By default, HubSpot will have the ‘add recipients’ check box selected at first, but if your email is for automation (workflow use) then go ahead and select ‘automation’ (below).</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ihAP58QvgPEI2EJMbteYVICS9GqVeBi9cWbKD7euME_eRjI7OeNU2BGbew52rAmV20fvHaU4eZCF-xq-mR3VP143dPv-cT892324z6_r5luo-sJBEjOWR1VjK2CoCm_bGgQ7GxJaEuOn1ceN"></figure>
<p>If you wish to add recipients, you can do so by either selecting the tab for ‘List’ or by ‘Individual contacts’ (below)</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/hc4MEq_vY4tdYD-qp-IwFPWjrmNSpfz80R96DgEq9Y6vGgYW33LvSLRH157rNsyJI-7wPLalBNKxfeyQABldOt2EyadliL4oo56_Mm8DATQO9uI3_Xt6bqZaNZVvrwRvDsyyUIsI4_UlZ3bs"></figure>
<p>From the Lists tab you can scroll down the lists available and choose your list, or if you know the name of your list enter it into the search bar.</p>
<p>For Individual contacts, you’ll need to enter the name of your contacts separately, so make sure to have them to hand.</p>
<p>When you proceed to select a list or contact for sending, by hovering over the entry HubSpot will provide you with the options for Include or Exclude. For example, if you have two lists with contacts shared across both, by including one but excluding the other, contacts in the excluded list would also be removed from sending even if they were part of the Include list.</p>
<p>Once a contact or list has been selected, its details will appear in either the ‘Send to’ or ‘Don’t send to’ boxes to right. If you wish to remove any contacts, select their name from theses boxes and click the ‘X’ button to remove them.</p>
<p>Once you’ve completed these steps, press save and proceed to the ‘Review tab.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Ch. 7.8 - Review&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By opening the Review tab (located towards the top of the page) you will open the page for ‘Review before you send’ which checks your emails for any inconsistencies.</p>
<p>The page will be split into three different sections.</p>
<p><strong>Finishing touches:</strong> Steps from previous topics that need completion</p>
<p><strong>Suggestions:</strong> Non-compulsory steps that need attention. However, its best practice to complete these steps anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Done:</strong> Completed steps (steps from ‘finishing touches’ will be moved here after completion)</p>
<p>This section is fairly straightforward – complete as necessary. Once you’ve completed these steps, press save and proceed to the ‘Send or schedule’ tab.</p>
<p>However, if you email is for Automation (workflow use) then you will not have this step, instead there should be a blue button called ‘save for automation’ towards the top right. Click it, to finish your automated email.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ahJzQ2kRz59VE93fls-BDlrUfWm1vvpC48GQ3TitG2PzGdHeNzxXNJQszj2U2ZAT-Z8TNHuJaANOpjW79iSLitcbmsquriOmS3G6R8vvnGCYAEecTyS9Vw-pL8N7QyvuDVD01mVdE0XRfekM"></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Ch. 7.9 - Send or Schedule&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the Send or schedule tab (located towards the top of the page) you can finalise the sending of your email. Please note, this option only appears if you’re sending your email to contacts, and not for automation.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/EbRb_qek5KCuqPDmKWvyQXul4i_QLAalxieEguo1GOI-CTxUs2bjSSJ4guLzPNUIB05dpsAMZlAwi3xjSPbhpz_0i2H7pe2bnqkmk9005g1aO5EQKRLP0to4f1ijwFNYIPSjVObQZ_Ao6N5q"></figure>
<p>The process from here is very simple, either choose ‘Send now’ followed by clicking the blue button called ‘Send’ towards the top-right of the page to finish. Or, choose ‘Schedule it for later’ followed by your details and then clicking the blue button called ‘Schedule’ towards the top-right of the page to finish.</p>

<h3>Ch. 8.1 - Creating a Website Page&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two ways to create a website page - choose whichever option is most suitable.</p>
<ol>
  <li>It’s perhaps easier to clone a website page that’s similar to the design and layout you want, and then editing the content rather than creating a new page from scratch.&nbsp;<br><br>As mentioned on the previous page, you can find the cloning option for a website page via the below:&nbsp;<br><br>“To manage these pages there are some hidden options available to the left of the created date for a website entry, hover your cursor in this section to view buttons for Edit, Clone, and More”&nbsp;<br><br>To clone a page, simply click the clone button, choose a new name, and you’re ready to edit/delete the existing content and settings to your needs.<br><br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Alternatively to create a new website page, click the blue button located towards the top-right hand side of the page called ‘Create a new website page’.</li>
</ol>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/DJqG0PqJKZcDXE6CgzpnCehiuWwYrMXFSMt5-oxPoTiPebnrimNQfk2w2Bs6jesx4FD1JnsnOVZ6ja8pRH2BcWR1nIDOan_Ck31MoEaQS9lu-ERQ8BLfVrKwKyqtrd8roH63aHgxVBs2PDWv"></figure>
<p>Once clicked, you’ll be redirected to a page which displays all the templates available to use.</p>
<p>Scroll through the templates to find a suitable design, or use the search-bar or drop-down ‘All folders’ menu&nbsp;to find a known template quicker.</p>
<p>Once found click you chosen template and enter a name – the more descriptive the better, then press ‘Create’ (below).</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/YtXYyzarYaUm22HPEm9tO9ameqOE2Hx8FSt9ThW_fDDtgWi4ZZM6y1obwyJyJ3EDDpb-zhQiVCFd98LQQe99_Dgm6AtLay0XxeCy8Nsm_bQFqKR-ay_e7NZ1IgEC1jhepkyAdkMyIZ8oeIbD"></figure>
<p>You’ll now be redirected to the Edit tab for your website page, where you can input your text with the Content Editor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instructions on how to use Content Editor please refer to <a href="Ch.-1---Content-Editor_4489374.html">chapter 1</a>, then once you’ve completed these steps, press save and proceed to the ‘Settings’ tab.</p>

<p>Use targeted keywords, but use them towards the beginning of your title rather than the end – search engines place more value on earlier words</p>
<p>Be brief, keep you text to around 5 words or &lt;4 keywords, as the maximum length of characters shown for pages titles is 70</p>
<p>Make the page title is actionable and appealing</p>
<p><strong>Page URL:</strong> A URL is automatically assigned using your page title, but you can manually edit it by clicking inside the text box - the shorter and more optimized the better here</p>

<p>The presented landing page dashboard will have opened under the ‘Manage’ tab, which displays all currently available landing page designs, both published and drafted. You can distinguish between them, as published pages will display a small green circle, and drafted pages will display a small grey circle.</p>
<p>You can sort the view of the ‘Manage’ tab, by selecting either Page Name, Last Updated, or Created Date.</p>
<p>In addition, there are three other menus to take note of, which:</p>
<p>All landing pages: Sorts between drafts, published, scheduled, and archived pages</p>
<p>All campaigns: Sort between campaigns</p>
<p>Folders: Sort between folders</p>
<p>To manage these pages there are some hidden options available to the left of the ‘created date’ for a website entry, hover your cursor over this section to view buttons for Edit, Clone, and More.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/frEqx5t2DUTJDWPicJJtQV-lILken8TvTpK-JTr-b_Ei-C0cM6qOQV8WqVdmG3-KZeeRQdpWlxWF-L49FENHz-nBtKfLynjao2m0dCUqV1iR32PVUBFCezyfqBFczdt5mmVxCePlOMf0YKd9"></figure>
<p>Changing the dashboard to the ‘Analyse’ function (below), will now show the associated metric data for these pages, all of which can be sorted by the options for Submissions, New Customers, and Customers, all of which can be cross-referenced by ‘All time’.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/hNSH4wSsA-3qbu5fCO-3_Nkx9lC4X3jslQ-5LTLQxhw2j8vxJUBUhkBxD6kBHZWLt-0YZY8a9R2icPFec0rj8QpLaHFLnKD3acV3hwN9bEylktpnsXGlEUYW9Fn3PImMKWcFgc_FtslEaePr"></figure>
<p>How to change a Landing Page into a Website Page:</p>
<p>To change a landing page into a website page (for whatever reason), click the dropdown menu for ‘more’ (located towards the far right) and choose ‘Move to website pages’.</p>
<p>A popup will then appear and state a condition of the move, if okay, press the ‘Move to Website Pages’ button to finish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Ch. 9.1 - Creating a Landing Page&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two ways to create a landing page.</p>
<ol>
  <li>It’s perhaps easier to clone a landing page that’s similar to the design and layout you want, and then editing the content rather than creating a new page from scratch.&nbsp;<br><br>As mentioned on the previous page, you can find the cloning option for a landing page via the below:&nbsp;<br><br>“To manage these pages there are some hidden options available to the left of the created date for a website entry, hover your cursor in this section to view buttons for Edit, Clone, and More”.&nbsp;<br><br>To clone a page, simply click the clone button, choose a new name, and you’re ready to edit/delete the existing content and settings to your needs.<br><br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Alternatively, to create a new landing page, click the blue button located towards the top-right hand side of the page called ‘Create a new landing page’.</li>
</ol>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/CiKsmIyZsLeum99jdbPCdeIYSJZLF6y0a6N_ITh5PLSAw8eQx1_AwwKVDi6-ttzqBXKPpoPyRFP1IPU66N5Ht3LM-5M7PI9RdoZrDeAjFMmz4pSH9hIy6S7JDzwuQ6up4n-aJetN2xmHHmsf"></figure>
<p>Once clicked, you’ll be redirected to a page which displays all the templates available to use. Scroll through the templates to find a suitable design, or use the search-bar or drop-down ‘All folders’ menu&nbsp;to find a known template quicker.</p>
<p>If you plan to use a form within your landing page design, make sure to choose a template with the form option available, which you can view easily enough by clicking on a template and preview it by clicking the magnifying glass. For further instructions, please go to the Forms section later on in this chapter now.</p>
<p>Once found, click you chosen template and enter a name – the more descriptive the better, then press ‘Create’ (below).</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/YtXYyzarYaUm22HPEm9tO9ameqOE2Hx8FSt9ThW_fDDtgWi4ZZM6y1obwyJyJ3EDDpb-zhQiVCFd98LQQe99_Dgm6AtLay0XxeCy8Nsm_bQFqKR-ay_e7NZ1IgEC1jhepkyAdkMyIZ8oeIbD"></figure>
<p>You’ll now be redirected to the Edit tab for your landing page, where you can input your text with the Content Editor. For instructions on how to use Content Editor please refer to <a href="Ch.-1---Content-Editor_4489374.html">chapter 1.</a> Then once you’ve completed these steps, press save and proceed to the ‘Settings’ tab.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Ch. 9.2 - Forms&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are a few extra points to cover if you’re using a form within your landing page design.</p>
<p>Firstly, if you need to collect new contact information that an existing form does not gather, then you will need to create a new form. Please see <a href="Ch.-4---Forms_12582962.html">chapter 4</a> for instructions. When your new form is ready, there are three ways you can insert it into a landing page design:</p>
<p>Clone a landing page and swap its existing form for your newly created form, in addition to editing all its content and settings - suggested method.</p>
<p>Create a new landing page template and insert your new form into its design, then develop a landing page from this. Please see <a href="Ch.-12---Template-Builder_12583177.html">chapter 12</a> for instructions.</p>
<p>Clone an existing landing page <u>template</u> and swap its existing form for your newly created form, then develop a landing page from this. Please see <a href="Ch.-12---Template-Builder_12583177.html">chapter 12</a> for instructions.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Actions:</strong> To edit a landing page’s form, click on its module within the ‘Edit’ tab and complete the following steps from within the presented box.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ioIB_X6Ic-WwSG29MCTCx9xXS1XsjpgtqH479rWVnx6roa4-G-YjozqvSaQJQfyV5gs4_zPQFJMiB-lGbuzc4Gx4cpPUl5RRSqWsUtdl-hstxnHtGFM9B8BOXI1GtRF9joRllzCNhaOb2uMm"></figure>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/K3IQjHOnTr7cWnrqQ7lxFXYkq0ccplamzcd4x3y-fnPMHvvAVi272FMHUWQFvpTopY9Ot7igrqVeXFeEA5PfQ5kvZhvoiRpGXaBN-IhzKqT_q_ObZNb-h_rYSQrK0b5cXvD3gqOQuD9d3tph"></figure>
<p><strong>Form title:</strong> Choose an actionable title that clarifies what the form offers</p>
<p><strong>Form:</strong> Use the existing form, swap for another, or create a new form</p>
<p>For instructions on how to create a Form, see <a href="Ch.-4---Forms_12582962.html">chapter 4.</a></p>
<p><strong>Visitor redirection:</strong> Choose where you want to send your visitors after they sign-up</p>
<p>Redirect to another page - send sign-ups to an existing thank you page (see <a href="Ch.-8---Website_12583088.html">chapter 8</a> for how to create new pages)</p>
<p>Display and inline thank you – this displays a message of your choosing on the current page</p>
<p>Out of the two options above, the most optimized method is to redirect your sign-up users to an alternative thank you page</p>
<p><strong>Form submission notifications:</strong> Have a notification email sent out when your form is completed, add you chosen email addresses here</p>
<p><strong>Add to workflow:</strong> When a contact completes your form have them added to an existing workflow, or create a new one (see <a href="Ch.-10---Workflows_12583140.html">chapter 10</a> for how create a workflow)</p>
<p><strong>Send a follow-up email:</strong> When a contact completes your form have them sent a specific email, or create a new one (see <a href="Ch.-7---Emails_12583058.html">chapter 7</a> for how create an email)</p>
<p>Once you’ve completed these steps, press save and proceed to the ‘Settings’ tab.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Ch. 9.3 - Settings&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clicking the ‘Settings’ tab towards the top of the page and enter the following information:</p>
<p><strong>Page name:</strong> Enter a name for internal reference (this will not be published)</p>
<p><strong>Page title:</strong> This is the bold text that shows up search engine result pages</p>
<p>Tips for making your page rank well</p>
<p>Honestly reflect the content of your page (or users just click away!)</p>
<p>Don’t duplicate or use text similar to other pages</p>
<p>Use targeted keywords, but use them towards the beginning of your title rather than the end – search engines place more value on earlier words</p>
<p>Be brief, keep you text to around 5 words or &lt;4 keywords, as the maximum length of characters shown for pages titles is 70</p>
<p>Make the page title is actionable and appealing</p>
<p><strong>Page URL:</strong> A URL is automatically assigned using your page title, but you can manually edit it by clicking inside the text box - the shorter and more optimized the better here</p>
<p>Domain: To the left of your URL box the domain is also displayed, click it to choose the right domain for your landing page</p>
<p><strong>Meta description:</strong> Add a Meta description to drive search engines to your page, but keep it under 160 characters, use keywords, and make sure it’s unique and actionable like a call-to-action.</p>
<p><strong>Campaign:</strong> Select a campaign or create a new one with ‘Add new’</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Ch. 9.4 - Advanced Settings&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Page settings</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Edit Head HTML:</strong> Add raw HTML snippets, embed codes, or tracking java scripts that will be added within the tag on your page.</p>

<p><strong>Template settings:</strong> Edit or swap you landing page template, but please note any changes you make might also affect other pages, and therefore this is not a recommended action. However if still needed, clone and save a template under a new name, then swap your landing page template for your cloned design and edit as necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Style settings:</strong> Due to my limited develop knowledge, I cannot explain the style sheet settings at this time</p>
<p>Once you’ve completed these steps, press Save and proceed to the ‘Publish or Schedule’ tab.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Ch. 9.5 - Publishing or Scheduling a Landing Page&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before completing this next section, make sure that all your orange to-do’s’ in ‘Optimise’ under ‘Edit’ are now green, and that your additional information under ‘Settings’ is also complete.</p>
<p>Publish or schedule your landing page under the third main subsection ‘Publish or Schedule’:</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/bAyH3RiAXrASxICe0atnqv0pZ00jmAeDN3zBSyTFJsehf8qAKW0e2MZVEqpz7A1vsoj54p8GPjA9dVeGbr0x6zX7Uzer87WhCUFFc4M_-PEllso7-MC-5Q2l35sAsL87lNAYy2SJY5OSoZvT"></figure>
<p>Select either the ‘Publish now’ option, to publish the post immediately, with up to a 15 minute wait time. Or select the ‘Schedule for later’ option and follow the presented instructions to schedule your message at the desired time.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/DznYaNJ3bfG-t5j5V4ylTv6SPxs9YPjotI1Akxg6aCvb_vYvEa12qRjhgeoQb7IiB33JeQokSyIHaiU45HuzdMjMuM7uNBQk_WnDqXT1qsNGnuiStH7sYBOjtC0soxegLv6ZKUJSnJyo1BhJ"></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Ch. 10 - Workflows&nbsp;</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To access Workflows from the main dashboard, navigate to Contacts &gt; Workflows. Please note, you can also read HS’s own guidance on this subject <a href="http://knowledge.hubspot.com/workflows-user-guide-v2/a-quick-tour-of-workflows"><u>here</u></a>.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/IP5OCYQonHFHBWNhKmND1XdiJ5Ul3XwHfX47g6mHSWZ629wpa0BFc63XTEEAeOw8-H8GbyS1epGhSe-LhZoI1SeEJt_2t6Qlt23VFcSoVQsa3BHt0P8KmMRmSz0QTkMr2MVuJ2Rge9Kj2P90"></figure>
<p>When opened, the presented dashboard will display every workflow currently created.</p>
<p>Workflows with a green dot indicate that they’re active, while workflows with a grey dot indicate that they’re inactive.</p>
<p>From here you can sort your view of these workflows by selecting either the Name, Total Contacts, Active Contacts, Last Modified, and Author (all shown below).</p>
<p>For clarification, the difference between Total Contacts and Active Contacts, is that the former includes all the contacts who’ve been entered into the workflow (including those who’ve completed it), against the latter of active contacts currently within it.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you can easily segment these workflows by selecting any of the drop-down menus for ‘All Workflows’, ‘All Personas’, and ‘All Authors’ (shown below).</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p5uCiueIcsQfE_babS-hsq4uID6pFT8JVyDelmNHF8jxFCgxjzV8_h7IeFgcBeoKDELyyNkkjvBKQAwnLVZFG0o-vMzBBZ-QbWnwb8KUY2t7S7zW8gl8YGa9_GZau_mfH1B3OhGwkWOxHju5"></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Ch. 10.1 - Workflow Preparation&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HS describes Workflows as the following: “A workflow is a series of automated actions that you can trigger to occur based on a person’s behaviours or contact information. Workflows go way beyond simple marketing automation, though. <strong>With workflows, you can send emails, update contact information, add or remove contacts from lists, and trigger email notifications.”</strong></p>
<p>Therefore to create a Workflow, it’s best to prepare the following elements in advance:</p>
<p>Have a clear objective(s) for your workflow.</p>
<p>Identify the HS segmentation properties or the list membership to enrol your audience.</p>
<p>Identify the HS segmentation properties that will track the completion of your main workflow objective(s) – these may differ from your enrolling requirements.</p>
<p>Draw a flow-chart with a pencil and paper, or try <a href="http://www.lucidchart.com"><u>www.lucidchart.com</u></a>.</p>
<p>Create your workflow content (usually emails). For instructions, please refer to the <a href="Ch.-7---Emails_12583058.html">chapter 7</a>.</p>
<p><br>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>As an example, here’s how we could employ the five actions above:</strong></p>
<p>We have the objective of getting new CMM contacts to configure an AWS server</p>
<p>We identify that our audience is segmented by the ‘Free Trial Contact List’</p>
<p>We also identify that we can track the main workflow objective through the HS contact property ‘Configured Server’</p>
<p>For clarity, we then create a flow-chart with the following actions and timings (below)</p>
<ol>
  <li>&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>Detail the list or segmentation properties of our audience</p>
<p>Send our segmented CMM audience the ‘Configure Server’ email</p>
<p>Add a 3 day delay</p>
<p>We then use the ‘Configured Server’ contact property to track if our users actually configured a server</p>
<p>If <u>Yes</u> - we send them a <u>new</u> ‘Configure Servers to be On-Demand’ email</p>
<p>If <u>No</u> - we resend then another ‘Configure Server’ email</p>
<p>We would then proceed to create this new Workflow within HS</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/7EE9hHVAhUTTmqes3CaGhXqHVBPOg_gnjhYuXNQnhTFHmFVd-5iUsgH7a97rlv81Gkw8e8cqIAkQij93OeLC4uuFx3vp3pJlTyYWvftTWEUKCtpYidJ7eYGu1wfdcXx1cp7Y3jYY6jgcnBvx"></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, when creating a new workflow for real; the area that will prove most difficult to users with a low-level of HS knowledge, is making sure to always use the correct HS contact properties. To which there is no shortcut other than familiarising yourself with them.</p>
<p>The best way to achieve this, is to create a test-list for your workflow within the Contacts section, and experiment with contact properties until you’re 100% sure that you’re pulling through the correct user information. For instructions on how to create a list, please see <a href="Ch.-11.2---Importing-a-List_12583170.html">chapter 11.2</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Ch. 10.2 - Creating a Workflow&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To create a new Workflow, look towards the upper right-hand side of the page and click the blue button called ‘Create new workflow’.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/CuVGwiui462jq2okv6gA1bWXak8kc3xbKJL_gCvcoRD4UsBep4EzZ3chdHxLk8tFXZAwetDzkZ232mqL64HflbVn6UB-o320hTTNd_bscNj0blZkB85y74OkJEKGb3XjcTQhF48UV5xKPKup"></figure>
<p>From the presented pop-up, choose a name for your workflow and a structure ‘type’ from either Standard, Fixed date, or Property-based.</p>
<p>A Standard workflow is triggered when a contact enrols after performing an action such as joining a HS list, visiting a page, or submitting a form.</p>
<p>A Fixed date workflow means that contacts are enrolled based around the same criteria as a Standard workflow, but it’s triggered against a calendar date.</p>
<p>A Property based workflow means that contacts are enrolled based around the same criteria as a Standard and Fixed date workflow, but it’s triggered against a <u>custom</u> contact date property.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Ch. 10.3 - Contact Enrolment&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please Note: The following sections for ‘Enrolment and Actions’ might prove difficult for those not familiar with HS, because they will present the user with a significant amount of unfamiliar data. As previously mentioned, you can make these sections easier by having an already prepared flow-chart, and a clear understanding of which HS contact properties pull in the right data. For instructions see <a href="Ch.-10.1---Workflow-Preparation_12583147.html">chapter 10.1</a>.</p>
<p>When presented with the main workflow creator, your first step is to choose whether workflow contacts should be enrolled automatically or manually.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/u1_FPqvX0ffGycLpmyz2gdl1dVQIMpLpszMw_EyiJC05JEg23LauRnC_59Zhuc28XbmNPrMklH4GlCYM0kcfKB6mVo0zO8xX43jbhOfWvWBkMYF9Uwne_G2k5XthZKfX8kzvLuu9bfHMZ4k2"></figure>
<p>For a manual enrolment, you can simply add contacts ‘ad-hoc’ by using the Enrol link towards the upper right-hand side of the page.</p>
<p>For an automatic enrolment, follow the on-screen instructions and choose from a list of 8 contact segments that will accurately target your audience (below), and follow the onscreen instructions.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/DMCcjM6REeto79Tfn18EaoGsONvA_KAUK2vEXKAkNUaIPXnPZQ3PWzeq_s1AIiHqQuarjKWv6oxaa1jCrU41jZoV0B4n9meURzqVzHRIh2I4C6LTV7ZE1_fAGpe0ounjQ6MR-glxKRd3Z0tr"></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Ch. 10.4 - Goals&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next you have the optional action of setting-up a workflow ‘Goal’. Which allows you to benchmark a list of HS contact properties that will automatically un-enrol an active contact when met (regardless of stage).</p>
<p>To do this, select the link called ‘Set a goal’ enter the contact properties for unenrollement, and finish by clicking the blue ‘set goal’ button (below).</p>
<p>Those that do become unenrolled are then counted at the top of the workflow, and help you to see how many contacts have completed the workflow. However this is an optional step, and don’t feel obliged to complete this, as most of the workflows for CMM do not include a goal (DD).</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Ay-N3C-XRlge9XVlTLJDioy_DTlABaC7YLOF63ITerMo5P1gqACVDWmscf7SBJjfvHsADgi0BXJG_X1Qbk2JSDvFNjK5gapAfGRX7Pal7hEiG-qJrRzUPbf7baPlneRVaqfqz14rRbfBCm_B"></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Ch. 10.5 - Actions&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After setting your enrolment properties, you can now create ‘actions’ and ‘timings’ for your workflow to execute. To do this, select the ‘Define this action’ text located underneath the enrolment options (shown below).</p>
<p>Then from the newly presented drop-down menu called ‘select an option’,&nbsp;choose and configure your workflow actions whilst also remembering to save! From here the process now involves you implementing yout prepared workflow actions and timings, but for reference, please see the list below for the most popular choices.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ClMCwNjCtAa-q_RR1DumUnbrXEs2cmHoC08r-eEeXgn1gWblHKk1fGV4TD7PLAy1Krb5dQfdRVqiqlhVDKdU51_xJ99ykjbVOIAAJkwaxajpsuGGuHq_Vl4OV1lG0YXLfqT2Yf6vsKqk8kWR"></figure>
<p><strong>Delay:</strong> Set a delay between workflow actions</p>
<p><strong>If/then branch:</strong> Choose a yes/no contact property that splits user, but remember to complete both sides of the branching!</p>
<p><strong>Send an email:&nbsp;</strong>Send an automated email to the contact going through a workflow</p>
<p>After you have set an action, you can then generate a proceeding one by using the text for ‘Add action or delay’ (as shown above), then repeat as necessary. You can then end the workflow by leading an action up to the ‘Workflow end’ text (below).</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/HsdHSA7sqT1kF8Q57-DW1tTEKdSFvXlfZQXP2KBE-d-yg4SD5-X9qP41ERoC-tMIx4Y9iuuB-3K4bAlyBy29epMdvyzJFvEr3v0fBfBxe239MTEA7yP8EJf3F9uuOiCco8G0Akn2MycJ2-Ms"></figure>
<p>Once all actions have been completed, test the workflow thoroughly (by enrolling yourself and completing each stage) using the ‘Test’ link located towards the upper right-hand corner.</p>
<p>However, just before you proceed to activate your workflow, access the workflows ‘Settings’ from the last option of the left-hand sidebar.</p>
<p>Most of the options here are self-explanatory, but it’s worth taking a closer look at the options for Suppressions &amp; Priorities. Again, you shouldn’t have any need to change these settings, but depending on what type of workflow you have created, edit as necessary.</p>
<p>Now you can switch on your workflow by using activation slider (below), which will publish just after before completing the pop-up for last minute checks.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/nzDUAjuNORcY7IBpsOq9bmMxiUnCMP-mxpYUyskljlr42wPHNwIkmh7N11JSbdD-_S0MNmHsk2qWMz_W4BLtjbwSytae39Md-D0yIcmbFtI6mTZZOUq5NNqmEwmi6Arf6Q_GHfjlQiQK57I-"></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Ch. 10.6 - Additional Areas&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now your workflow is complete, you can choose to view its Performance and History, through the left-hand menu (shown below):</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/UEhCflfH0r-PsOq3UdUZlUSsI7mwmm2DzNZ6u--algAkIEpdop5SX1K0G7f2MHAu7c1toiYZ8xfjF5-M4v8djJ1pFRMS6jEM3Eqxl8ckfHTWNceq0366lEhLjP94W6oH8U-Of_f5ztThC1Gs"></figure>
<p>Performance: This page will detail how well your workflow emails are performing, and includes metric data on open rates, click through rates, and bounce rates. It’s a good idea to check this page from time-to-time to see if anything needs attention.</p>
<p>History: A chronological timeline of all executed actions from your workflow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Ch. 11 - Lists&nbsp;</h2>
<p><br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To access Lists from the main dashboard, navigate to Contacts and click &gt; Lists. Please note, you can read HS’s own guidance on this subject <a href="http://knowledge.hubspot.com/lists-user-guide/how-to-create-a-list-of-your-contacts"><u>here</u></a>.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/6YF4OD4WWUV9JaK5VCxf5qWq7s_E_N2kEpC9iuRDMLvqpOC9bc3BZYTrzMVU9WfR5ZDx5rtPVWLsVfwG3vfprv0STRgczeAMBC3zi-5VXp-SLBZwtqScTmtDKCJVk25k3UIbXLnKz7qEL0Ch"></figure>
<p>The page will open upon the main dashboard for lists and display all the currently available static and smart lists used on HubSpot.</p>
<p>You can segment this view by clicking the drop down menus for ‘All list types’ and ‘All authors’ located towards the top right of this page, or by using the search bar to find an already know list.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you can sort the order of these lists by clicking on the column headers:</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Fv7iD3FL3bs1XJQiaRDgfnt44JPw8B7JYuca7REbjvU3G_EIY391OkSCpUde9vSosj7zpI2Y3N4cx5WcOYu3o_3yPn9iw-fIrAs60ozodzciIajuO6sDWhGww8FYFgfEiRB-_6DV3cjgn7Xx"></figure>

<p>Folder</p>
<p>By selecting either a list’s individual <strong>check box, </strong>or by selecting the column headers <strong>check box </strong>(as shown above),&nbsp;the features below become available:</p>
<p><strong>Move list:</strong> move your list to a folder (you can create folders from the left-hand side menu)</p>
<p><strong>Delete list:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Export list:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Clone list:</strong> You can only clone smart lists</p>
<p>Lastly, be aware that the left-hand side menu bar is a shared menu bar, also available from the dashboards for workflows, forms, and lead scoring, and provides a quick way to navigate between these features.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Ch. 11.1 - Static and Smart Lists&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What’s the difference between a static and a smart list?</p>
<p><strong>Static lists:</strong> Static lists are created automatically when you import a list into HubSpot or they can be created by selecting a list criteria. &nbsp;Once a static list is generated, the list members will remain the same unless you add or remove contacts manually (explanation via HubSpot).</p>
<p><strong>Common uses:</strong></p>
<p>Imported data from another database</p>
<p>Email blasts</p>
<p>Internal staff lists</p>
<p>Event/trade show lists</p>
<p>Manually adding contacts to workflows</p>
<p><br>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Smart lists:</strong> Smart lists offer a flexible way to organize contacts in HubSpot and automate your marketing actions. You can build these automatically refreshing lists based on contacts who meet&nbsp;certain criteria, and removing contacts that no longer meet that criteria (explanation via HubSpot).</p>
<p><strong>Common uses:</strong></p>
<p>Contact property segmentation</p>
<p>Form completions</p>
<p>Workflow completions</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Ch. 11.2 - Importing a List&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To import a list into HubSpot, head to the list’s dashboard and click the import button located towards the top right of the page (below).</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/HKZrq2U4VfydYTljgZXLrWPqdiDAWPnqIXjSCRR0alAtEsb0-vsMcIyyNMIGBgbwUeuA44_x79IIpGA2po1LyOChFeglONLwvCAd4JiSEzoOTO7sHVabflvrjlaO9N33xWHdcF4MBS4ejaS3"></figure>
<p>From the opened page press the blue ‘Import contacts’ button, and follow the steps below:</p>
<p>Choose a CSV file and press upload.</p>
<p>Choose a name for your list then press ‘Next, map your properties’.</p>
<p>Match the column labels from your CSV to the relevant HubSpot properties, then press next.</p>
<p>Confirm the validity of your data by selecting the true options from the radio boxes, then confirm your initials and press import contacts.</p>
<p>You’ll then have a slight delay before your contacts are fully imported.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Ch. 11.3 - Creating a List&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To create a new list, look towards the upper right-hand side of your page and click the blue button called ‘New list’.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/uwWWqc8n8UK46cXFjUAmNB3-xFkNtG7SMS762BHpW-SuEimGhg82YjHcKtepgChw-wxl9afwRqNTVJLjNpkIKd8vZyUMy63CbWioOE5T6-vdp0G4eKuSrHgAFvRl9DezOW0kQ9KEqYzvjmRy"></figure>
<p>From the opened page look towards the left hand side and click ‘Name list’.</p>
<p>Enter a name for your list and choose whether to have a smart or static list by selecting the appropriate radio button, then click the blue button for ‘Save’.</p>
<p>Also from this left hand side you’ll also see options for ‘Segment contact by’, which include:</p>
<p>Contact property</p>
<p>List membership</p>
<p>Form submission</p>
<p>Email</p>
<p>Page view</p>
<p>Event</p>
<p>Workflow status</p>
<p>Call-to-Action</p>
<p>Please note, different segmenting options will require different types of information, so it’s best to have a clear understanding of who you’re trying to segment.</p>
<p>From these options choose your segmenting parameters:</p>
<ol>
  <li>&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>In my case I chose ‘Form Submission’.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/r-h1sQDlelmcj7QciSMOty6P6SLrNT1SuyoNwj5Q5rLeAcs4xi-TdOjR6Kmzd74B-jQQ4JuNuff45rNY6PemQmB5sQWGQxEVNibSFblGKrz_0lzE02z2uQdzuOyv3zdIywZb4MWA-9CDxYeS"></figure>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;6. I then click the dropdown menu for ‘any form’ and click the entry for ‘Register for CMM’.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;7. This action then changes the right hand side of my page to a preview of those contacts who’ve completed this form</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 8. Potentially, I could choose to segment my list further and only show contacts who’ve completed my form via specific pages, by clicking the ‘any page’ dropdown menu and selecting the related page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 9. Additionally, by clicking the ‘Refine by…’ button I can segment my contacts even further by the following options.</p>
<ol>
  <li>&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>No filter</p>
<p>Rolling dates</p>
<p>On or before date</p>
<p>On or after date</p>
<p>Between dates</p>
<p>Number of times</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 10. When I’ve chosen my segmentation options, I click ‘Done’, and am redirected back to enter further options.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 11. From here, by clicking ‘and’ you can add additional segmenting steps to what you’ve already done.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 12. Or by clicking ‘or…’ you can additional segmenting steps alongside what you’ve already done.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 13. When you’ve completed all you segmenting options click ‘Save’ and then press ‘Back to lists’ to finish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Ch. 12 - Template Builder&nbsp;</h2>
<p><br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To create a HubSpot template navigate to Content and click &gt; Design Manager. Please note, you can read HS’s own guidance on this subject <a href="http://knowledge.hubspot.com/design-manager-user-guide-v2/how-to-structure-and-customize-template-layouts"><u>here</u></a>.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/dzeIYzZKvOuKr2HCvmFFKsrj72zqjT0ZgLEt9xO1uoiDHVqNRwAstnUFUaSlJQZ4sWEpUkD-t7r3BEXUert8jKS5CZXpPbBQ5-aKty9N9HlGsoeeiKmbkQ-9o_VWyzXdxP-p56PLW4uxb9Px"></figure>
<p>Unlike HubSpot’s other features, the design manager allows you to view editable templates through ‘page tabs’ rather than having just a singular page open for editing.</p>
<p>As such, when you open the design manager from the main dashboard it will subsequently direct to your last open page (alongside any other open templates), rather than forwarding you to an overview page. If you haven’t worked upon a page previously, then it will simply open a ‘New tab’ and display a default view for ‘Recently Edited’ templates.</p>
<p>To find a specific template you can either search through the left-hand menu folders (shown below), or enter your templates name into the search bar. When found, click on your template to be forwarded to its editing tab.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/TJzOt5piRpMAvtn7_VXTaGuDYiC8uxntuiNVsSxGoxQm6ts3UwL-GU6oyN4oO0oBkN1D-8NFOT38JIrtdIavfxeoOQjoN9NLjYL8Z9O174xe1wxLc73V3NssCl7UiKj8ZjVpLZ7x3Uuba-RO"></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Ch. 12.1 - Creating a Template&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To create a new template, look towards the upper right-hand side of your page and click the blue button called ‘New template’.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/eD5fHMFToMMajDmVsc82bAKNhxB8c0DmzRkvGHUa7YnujN05ub_KsHSL-CLrBB6-btt8EZJF7SRzuKUIqltPOXGHNvJpTrmknuliSKfgO8nx2nWfjfW521Jip-1BvJot9Q4qS1PjJlxEx11E"></figure>
<p>From the opened popup select the ‘Template Builder’ option, then choose your content type from the options below, then create.</p>
<p>Page (for website and landing pages)</p>
<p>Email</p>
<p>Blog</p>
<p>System (ignore)</p>
<p>Please note, there are some differences in what modules you can utilise between each template type, but the process is mostly the same.</p>
<p>Once you’ve clicked ‘Create’ another popup will open for ‘Save new page template’ where you can enter a ‘File name’ and choose which folder to sort your template into. If there isn’t a folder to sort your template into, create one by clicking the ‘New folder’ button.</p>
<p>When finished press ‘Save’ to be forwarded to the editing tab.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Ch. 12.2 - Add and Drag Modules&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the editing tab you can add and swap the modules you want to use within your template.</p>
<p>The quickest way to add a module is by clicking the ‘add row’ button towards the bottom of your page (adding a module directly above your cursor).</p>
<p>From here, drag the module and reposition it as necessary, or place it over a module to segment it in different ways – experiment as needed.</p>
<p>In addition, clicking the gear icon&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/2PStTJ179WvXiRaGzEV-NjcEk7GCoRlJV565n0qqg-K6edy2gXna_BPGn2DFaQhmymxctFn7lLjZCa5FsKqJHHezzV7bpi1SHLApz0GZ9t-FyxBgdzD_-IBMqRZzQPoS5STus1p0EyFnY1ku"></figure>
<p>towards the right hand side of each module will present the following options:</p>
<p><strong>Edit options:</strong></p>
<p>Change the label name for your selected module (helps when dealing with many modules)</p>
<p>Add default support text to your selected module, to help when entering further content for blogs, email, and webpages.</p>
<p>Please note, edit options will vary depending on the module selected</p>
<p><strong>Make smart:</strong> make the module smart</p>
<p><strong>Lock Module:</strong> lock the module to prevent others from editing the HTML properties</p>
<p><strong>Edit CSS:</strong></p>
<p>Customize the HTML mark-up of your template for the following:</p>
<p>Custom CSS Class (advanced)</p>
<p>Custom Inline Styling (advanced)</p>
<p>Custom Wrapping HTML (advanced)</p>
<p><strong>Swap module:</strong></p>
<p>Swap the module type for something else, like a form or global module for example</p>
<p><strong>Make module global:</strong></p>
<p>Make you module global to use it across other templates</p>
<p>Please note, any changes to a global module will carry across other linked templates – proceed with caution</p>
<p><strong>Split horizontally:</strong> Split the selected module in two</p>
<p><strong>Add module below:</strong> Add and a group a module below the selected module</p>
<p><strong>Delete Module:</strong></p>
<p>Deletes the module</p>
<p>Please note, deleting a module may also delete it from other templates where it is used – proceed with caution</p>
<p>To adjust the proportions of a split row, place you cursor over the line in the middle, click and hold, then drag from left to right as needed (shown below)</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_TkVm3bhMsX-2rX2M6j_R5QYLaPaFagHJV3DrCyT7W4xJu6mmQ8lRuLgGjFx3QjuhFdn07loez31_N4_P_GSZkU2LjVLzInnQFogrCr5pXOovJEQiZ2stCWVSpXtMTfb-Js9VxwJo7Xanhn3"></figure>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5. To check how your template looks after placing a module, click the ‘Preview’ button towards the top centre of your page (shown below).</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/5B3I4pJXw3ISDIq824-YHT7xozHlYaNnWTZqfq43KprrJsiyWJ7caPtsYPmyPkUcLIH64sEC8Szv0i4eJ3EWlAwwAoUmWdtkfurWReXceP3yzFPj3__OTp_clW53ZLJlDjivzSrUKM7m4a3p"></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Ch. 12.3 - Grouping Modules&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To group modules together press the ‘Group…’ button and select your modules in rectangular groupings.</p>
<p>Incompatible groupings will be highlighted in red, while compatible groupings will be highlighted in green.</p>
<p>When you have a compatible group click the blue ‘create group’ button to finish.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Please note, you can also make grouped modules ‘global’</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Ch. 12.4 - Actions&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are some other important options you might to consider via the dropdown menu for ‘Actions’ (shown below), adjust as necessary:</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/hPmy3zzZ5gIqAhIPSD1vjqI12W3HUiRJlQbxucUPe7tJFJa6jPj83hD-X7OW0tiy3rpOTPJ1tdSSXXkFE30L2f3iPZINThRmNpAPQhZHD60Mz6-pIpt7XEirROS7JwXuDRizIloH1eDWkTv1"></figure>
<p><strong>Save</strong>: Save the changes made to your draft but be aware this does not affect published pages.</p>
<p><strong>Move or rename template:</strong> Rename and more your template to the appropriate folder.</p>
<p><strong>Clone</strong>: Clone your template (great for when creating variations of existing content).</p>
<p><strong>Clone to file:</strong> Clone a separate HTML version of your template.</p>
<p><strong>Create a page from template:</strong> Create landing page directly from design manager (great for saving time).</p>
<p><strong>View revisions:</strong> Rollback your template to a previously published design.</p>
<p><strong>Pages using template:</strong> See where else this template is being used.</p>
<p><strong>Delete</strong>: Delete your template but be aware you cannot retrieve it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Ch. 12.5 - Publishing&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When happy with your template changes finish your design by pressing the green ‘publish changes’ button.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/y0AVYqbrepTTzhRQDMnLaXDi-CusHR6JP1uwEgGb-4UH7uwzt_B0TB3veTBgyyWFpZC8HUHuCdCS9ItwyfCAvi0QUtHdrr3-ezvmjj7L7KqKD6voenmTScDpCm_-2LF-pb0k5j4J96XUI8G7"></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Ch. 13 - Reports / Sources&nbsp;</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To access Reports / Sources navigate to Reports and click &gt; Sources. Please note, you can read HS’s own guidance on this subject<a href="https://knowledge.hubspot.com/sources-user-guide-v2/how-to-use-sources-report-to-measure-your-marketing-campaigns">&nbsp;here</a>.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/12583359/12583368.png"></figure>
<p>The presented page shows a table of source data broken down by a specific web domain and date range – with different colours representing various channels (as shown below).</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/12583359/12583376.png"></figure>
<p>To break this data down further, click the button for 'Standard / Cumulative' and the drop down menu for 'Visits &gt; Contacts / Customers’ as needed.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/12583359/12583375.png"></figure>
<p>To discover more information on a particular source, click any of the highlighted options for Organic Search', 'Referrals' etc., to see what channels / entries contribute towards that source’s result.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/12583359/12583377.png"></figure>
<p>To choose a specific domain, click the drop down menu for ‘All domains’ and choose your preferred domain. However, if your domain does not exist, then you’ll need to contact the person currently managing HubSpot (it’s not an easy fix).</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/12583359/12583378.png"></figure>
<p>In addition, to find out which source has created the most contacts, and to find out who these contacts are - click the highlighted stats in the ‘Contacts’ column.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/12583359/12583380.png"></figure>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/12583359/12583381.png"></figure>
<p>This information is particularly useful for any monthly statistics reporting - which you can learn how to do <a href="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/display/MC/Statistics+Collection+Instructions">here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Ch. 14 - URL Mapping&nbsp;</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To access URL Mapping navigate to Content and click &gt; Content Settings. Please note, you can read HS’s own guidance on this subject <a href="https://knowledge.hubspot.com/website-user-guide/how-to-use-the-url-mapping-tool-to-redirect-pages"><u>here</u></a>.</p>
<p><br>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/3r-wZRHpZKRxnlOQzN58-riCL-za2vg3zChp6afTIEXhv-qsSnbSt6_lGTga76K3z66IeUmSn7nuXfdbeyH5YgY2R7ASeTMbUdVWBDZ-RzQLvfxjzC1N6sNdN7lzTXF8Nt1aNmQ"></figure>
<p>From here look to the left hand side for a link called ‘COS URL Mappings’ &gt; click it. From here you can edit or create new URL mappings.</p>
<p><strong>To create a new URL mapping:</strong></p>
<p>To create a new URL mapping press, the ‘Add a new redirect’ button towards the top right hand side.</p>
<p>From here, simply add the URL address which you wish to redirect to ‘Original URL or path’ and add the new destination URL to ‘Destination URL or path’. In most cases, you can leave the ‘Redirect Type’ to ‘Permanent (301)’ - I’ve never had a need to change it.</p>
<p><strong>To edit an existing URL mapping:</strong></p>
<p>The easiest way to find and edit an existing URL (rather than searching page by page), is to paste the exact web address into the search bar and hit go. Once found, you can edit the URL by clicking the ‘gear’ icon underneath the ‘Actions’ column and pressing ‘edit’.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From here you can change the ‘Original URL or path’ or ‘Destination URL or path’ as needed - but please make sure any changes made are accurate. In most cases, you can leave the ‘Redirect Type’ to ‘Permanent (301)’ - I’ve never had a need to change it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Ch. 15 - Adding to the Navigation Menu&nbsp;</h2>
<p>To add to the navigation menu, navigate to Content and click &gt; Content Settings. Please note, you can read HS’s own guidance on this subject <a href="https://knowledge.hubspot.com/website-user-guide/how-to-use-the-url-mapping-tool-to-redirect-pages"><u>here</u></a>.</p>
<p>Note, for this process to work, you must’ve published the page you wish to link to - if you haven't done this, go back and publish your page.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/3r-wZRHpZKRxnlOQzN58-riCL-za2vg3zChp6afTIEXhv-qsSnbSt6_lGTga76K3z66IeUmSn7nuXfdbeyH5YgY2R7ASeTMbUdVWBDZ-RzQLvfxjzC1N6sNdN7lzTXF8Nt1aNmQ"></figure>
<p style="text-align:center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the opened page, look to the LHS and click a link called ‘Advanced Menus’ &gt; then from the drop down menu for 'default', choose the domain you wish to add to.</p>
<p>Find the page or subpage you wish to follow-on from &gt; click the ‘Add page’ button &gt; and choose your URL (below) &gt; then click 'Choose page'.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/12583397/12583394.png"></figure>
<p>Click the ‘Link Settings’ (gear) icon to choose your menu's label name &gt; then click 'Save'.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/12583397/12583395.png"></figure>
<p>You can now publish or save the page as a draft.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/12583397/12583396.png"></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>However</strong>, be aware that if you don’t publish your changes, they’ll remain (saved) within the same draft until someone else revisits them – which can be potentially dangerous. As another user could publish their own work and not be aware of your&nbsp; unfinished changes. Therefore, make sure any changes you make are fully completed, and not left saved within a draft</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Ch. 16 - A/B Testing&nbsp;</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><i>Creating an A/B test - HubSpot:</i></h3>
<p><i>&nbsp;</i><strong>1.&nbsp;Changing a HubSpot 'Website Page' into a 'Landing Page'&nbsp;:</strong></p>
<p><i><strong>&nbsp;</strong></i></p>
<ul>
  <li>To perform an A/B Test, your HubSpot page must be a 'Landing Page'.</li>
</ul>
<p>To change a website page into a landing page, find your page in 'Website Pages' &gt; click the dropdown menu for ‘more’ (located towards the far right) &gt; choose ‘Move to landing pages’.</p>
<p>A popup will then appear and state a condition of the move, if okay, press the ‘Move to Landing Pages’ button to finish.</p>
<p><br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;</i><strong>2. Setting up a HubSpot Landing Page A/B Test:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Click on your Landing Page (via 'Landing Pages) &gt; click 'Edit' &gt; click 'Settings' &gt; click 'Create and A/B Test' - give your variation a (easy and accurate) name &gt; click 'Okay'<ul>
      <li>This process also works if you've created a new Landing Page.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>After this change, you'll now see a green/blue 'A/B' icon next to the top-left text for 'Back to landing pages'.<ul>
      <li>Clicking either of these 'A' or 'B' buttons allows you to switch your view between either page.</li>
      <li>Essentially, treat each page as a seperate entitity, and make your specifc changes. To learn more about creating a landing page, please see the <a href="Ch.-9.1---Creating-a-Landing-Page_12583129.html">HubSpot Wiki.</a></li>
      <li><strong>Note</strong>, changes made to one page should not affect the other - unless it's a change to a global template module which your two pages share.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>To publish a variation, click the blue 'Publish' button on the top-right of each page.</li>
  <li>To stop or choose a variation winner, click on your Landing Page (via 'Landing Pages) &gt; click 'Variations' &gt; click 'Choose as winner'.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>&nbsp;</i><strong>3. Enabling Google Analytics A/B Tracking:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>To enable Google Analytics tracking, each variation will need a specific piece of code inserted into it's header.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li>
  <li>To do this for your 'A' page &gt; open you 'A' page and click 'Settings' &gt; click 'Edit HTML settings' &gt; insert '<strong>&lt;meta name="bbmarketing-abtest" content="A"&gt;</strong>' at the top of the entry box, and before any other code (if present).</li>
  <li>To do this for your 'B' page &gt; open you 'A' page and click 'Settings' &gt; click 'Edit HTML settings' &gt; insert '<strong>&lt;meta name="bbmarketing-abtest" content="B"&gt;</strong>' at the top of the entry box, and before any other code (if present).</li>
  <li>To remove this code, simply delete it from the header file.</li>
  <li>After 1-2 days (after GA has recorded some traffic), these results will show in GA with the end of their URL showing '<strong>/?abtest=A</strong>' and '<strong>/?abtest=A</strong>' respectively.<br>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Note</strong>, I would advise to only have this code implemented across one A/B test at a time. However, if you wish to run additional tests, I would contact Alex Putnam and ask him to adapt the code.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

<h1>Wistia Assessment&nbsp;</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>New Update (21/04/2016)</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>If you just want to embed your videos onto a site, you can use any plan and have the ability to upload media, customize, embed it, and check on stats. You can be on any video plan found on <a href="http://www.wistia.com/pricing">www.wistia.com/pricing</a>.</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>&nbsp;</strong>$0 pm – 5 videos - all features – Wistia branded player</li>
  <li>$25 pm – 25 videos - all features – No Wisita branded player</li>
  <li>$50 pm – 50 videos - all features - No Wisita branded player</li>
  <li>$100 pm – 100 videos - all features - No Wisita branded player</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>The $300 integration is only necessary if you want to bring leads directly into HubSpot via Turnstile or if you wish to start passing Wistia's viewing data over into your HubSpot account to further run automation (or workflows) off of that data.</p>
<p><strong>How much does it cost?</strong></p>
<p>Integration on the HubSpot side is free, but Wistia requires you to sign up for the $300 per month licence to use the integration. Integration in HubSpot is also for a portal, not a domain. So it should be available across the domains we have in that portal.</p>

<p><a href="http://59827.hs-sites.com">59827.hs-sites.com</a></p>
<p>Confirmed from Wistia themselves:</p>
<p>“Wistia Enterprise is $300 and you can use the Wistia account for as many domains as you'd like.”</p>
<p><br>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What benefits does it provide?</strong></p>
<p>The biggest benefit of Wistia right now for Blueberry is that it gives us stats, integrates nicely with the website (we have the ability to change the colour of the play bar etc. to make it fit in with the brand) and it tells us how much of a video is being watched by people.</p>
<p>Where the enhanced video stats are particularly useful is to see which videos are being watched, and how long people are watching for - i.e &nbsp;only watching for 20 seconds and then clicking off. We'll know that people aren't engaged with the content</p>
<p>Wistia basically sets you apart from YouTube and Vimeo as being more of a business tool as opposed to a general video hosting site. We could effectively put all of our video content on there.</p>
<p><br>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What analytics does it provide?</strong></p>
<p>You can see if a HS contact has viewed a video from their timeline</p>
<p>You can segment HS contacts based upon what videos they have watched</p>
<p>You can see which videos help drive conversions</p>
<p>Provides heat mapping - how much and what parts of a video are being watched</p>
<p>See where users click on the video (annotations and CTA’s)</p>
<p>You can include videos within our emails campaigns</p>
<p>You can use smart-lists to identify and segment users into a workflow, for those who have watched a video 100% etc or by many times they’ve viewed it</p>
<p>You can run reports to see how HubSpot videos are performing, and how they affect conversion rates</p>
<p><br>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SEO</strong></p>
<p>Video SEO is when videos show up in Google in the form of <a href="https://developers.google.com/structured-data/rich-snippets/?hl=en"><u>rich snippets</u></a> results, where they would display a video thumbnail, making them better at generating traffic. Also, pages that host a video are more likely to get found in search engines because google ranks them higher.</p>
<p>However, these days video content is less frequently shown in search, and only the most credible websites or Youtube seem to get ranked. All of which can change at Google’s discretion.</p>
<p>The way you rank a video with SEO, is by using a sitemap and the correct keyword metadata for your video with descriptions and transcript information, all of which you can do with a Wistia account.</p>
<p>How would Blueberry use it?</p>
<p>At the moment and to the best of my knowledge, Blueberry has only one promotional video for CMM, and a number of support videos for…</p>
<p>Tutorial support videos (flashback and cmm)</p>
<p>Thought leader videos (Martin)</p>
<p>Webinars (potential area from CMM)</p>
<p><br>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Alternatives</strong></p>
<p>YouTube and Vimeo are other options but don't integrate with HubSpot, but a Youtube player can work with Google Analytics:</p>
<p>Dave Francis:</p>
<p>I've been using Google Analytics 'events' on another product. Our JS sends an 'event' to GA, and we can use that in examining stats. Its very easy to use. If we sent an event from CMM when the video was played, we could compare the % of people that convert (to whichever goal) after watching the video to the % that don't watch it (as well as easily see how many played it).</p>
<p>Maybe figure its effectiveness. If we find it significantly increases conversions, it might be worth considering getting a new movie for FB.</p>
<p>Or we could A-B test the page, one with video and one without. I'm very interested in using A-B testing and GA events to tune the FB site.</p>
<p><br>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Assessment</strong></p>
<p>Wistia seems like a nice and useful addition to HS, but it's not something DD are pushing as crucial for CMM (at least), and it would cost us $3,600 per annum - for all domains.</p>
<p>Having the analytics described would be very productive for videos that encourage a signup, but at present these videos are in limited use, and the majority of videos are post-sale and support based.</p>
<p>If implemented now, Wistia could tell us how many sign-ups watched a video, and for how long before registering. We could then create a conversion rate for those that have watched a video, against those who didn’t, and base further video development around this.</p>
<p>However without any video metrics, it’s impossible to tell whether any of our existing videos make a difference to conversions. It may be useful to implement a youtube player as a pilot test (as Dave has suggested), and see how many sign-ups complete the goal of watching the video.</p>
<p>Or perhaps a faster option is implement Wistia for a limted time (maybe 2 -3 months), once the rate of sign-ups has increased (CMM, maybe not relevant to FB), and we can make more of an informed decision towards it’s permanent usage.</p>
<p>In CMM’s case, I would see further video content focusing on our target customer personas, and higher funnel content like webinars. Whereas for FB and consult, videos might be more generalised.</p>
<p>However, if we did implement Wistia on a permanent basis, &nbsp;there’d have to be a greater focus on video development for a larger ROI, which would pull attention away from other areas such as content which forms our marketing backbone.</p>
<p><br>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>In conclusion, video content does not seem to be as prominent as it once was in google search, but more than likely will still help web pages rank higher.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally,because we don't have to many promotional videos at the moment (to my knowledge), Wistia is probably not worth the cost at present, but is perhaps something we should revisit after our text-based content marketing has truly taken effect. To where we can create videos targeted more towards our marketing personas, and integrate them into higher funneled-content workflows.</p>

<h2><strong>Free Tools:</strong></h2>
<h2>Page information and research developed by Stelios Dritsas - <a href="mailto:stelios.dritsas@bbconsult.co.uk">stelios.dritsas@bbconsult.co.uk</a>:</h2>
<h3>1) Woorank &amp; Woorank Chrome Plugin</h3>
<p>Woorank is a Freemium tool, which means it has some free options like the link below and for more in depth analysis a payment plan. I found that the free options are quite useful and sufficient for an overview of a sites performance and attributes. The plug-in for chrome, according to users, also offers some valuable info. It scrapes your site and tells you of any inefficiencies, even offering checklists to complete. Users also say that it is a great tool to get an overview of your site and competitors.</p>

<h3>2) SEMrush</h3>
<p>As a freemium model SEMrush allows you limited access to the data, however searching and using the filters will allow you to uncover a little more data. In short, it allows you to track any domain or Keywords from any geographical location, discovering local competitions and lets you target different devices too.</p>
<p>SEMrush's free tools provide insights into keyword performance, such as which sites rank in Google's top 100 results for a given keyword. You can also plug in URLs to get information on sites' traffic, keyword ads, organic versus ad traffic, organic keywords, and more.</p>

<h3>3) Screaming Frog SEO Spider</h3>
<p>According to user Screaming Frog is superb at scraping a site, much like a search engine would. It runs it's rule over all links and pages of the website offering data on Status Codes, Page Titles, Meta Descriptions, Robots Meta Data and put it all into a filterable spreadsheet.</p>

<h3>4) SEOCentro SEO Analyzer for Website and Content Analysis</h3>
<p>SEOCentro's SEO Analyzer is "a brilliant free SEO tool that I recommend at all my speaking events," says Shannon K. Steffen, founder and CEO of Daymark Digital. "Although it won't tell you how to fix SEO problems on your website, it will give you a great snapshot of what's broken and what's working. Make sure to scroll to the bottom to see what your top keywords are on that Web page. If your top keyword is 'read more,' you'll want to work on content optimization."</p>

<h3>5) Moz Open Site Explorer for Backlink Analysis and Website Authority</h3>
<p>Moz's SEO tools are mostly available in paid plans that cost $99 a month or more. However, you can use one of its more compelling features, Open Site Explorer, for free. Open Site Explorer is a "brilliant" link analysis tool that provides "insight into your website's inbound links, authority, page link metrics, top pages, linking domains, and top landing pages," according to Steffen of Daymark Digital.</p>
<p>The tool also gives you a handle on the authority of an entire site or a particular page. "By knowing these data points, you can further optimize pages with already existing authority so that they convert better, and you can create a link-building strategy that will further increase your authority online," Steffen says.</p>
