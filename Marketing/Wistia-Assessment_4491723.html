Integration in HubSpot is also for a portal, not a domain. So it should be available across the domains we have in that portal.</span></p><ol><li style="list-style-type: decimal;"><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);text-decoration: none;"><a class="external-link" href="http://flashbackrecorder.com" rel="nofollow">flashbackrecorder.com</a></span></p></li><li style="list-style-type: decimal;"><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);text-decoration: none;"><a class="external-link" href="http://cloudmachinemanager.com" rel="nofollow">cloudmachinemanager.com</a></span></p></li><li style="list-style-type: decimal;"><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);text-decoration: none;"><a class="external-link" href="http://bbconsult-co.hs-sites.com" rel="nofollow">bbconsult-co.hs-sites.com</a></span></p></li><li style="list-style-type: decimal;"><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);text-decoration: none;"><a class="external-link" href="http://59827.hs-sites.com" rel="nofollow">59827.hs-sites.com</a> </span></p></li></ol><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,255);text-decoration: none;">Confirmed from Wistia themselves:</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,255);text-decoration: none;">“</span><span style="color: rgb(0,0,255);text-decoration: none;">Wistia Enterprise is $300 and you can use the Wistia account for as many domains as you'd like.”</span></p><p><strong><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);text-decoration: none;"><br/></span></strong></p><p><strong><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);text-decoration: none;">What benefits does it provide?</span></strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);text-decoration: none;">The biggest benefit of Wistia right now for Blueberry is that it gives us stats, integrates nicely with the website (we have the ability to change the colour of the play bar etc. to make it fit in with the brand) and it tells us how much of a video is being watched by people.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);text-decoration: none;">Where the enhanced video stats are particularly useful is to see which videos are being watched, and how long people are watching for - i.e  only watching for 20 seconds and then clicking off. We'll know that people aren't engaged with the content</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);text-decoration: none;">Wistia basically sets you apart from YouTube and Vimeo as being more of a business tool as opposed to a general video hosting site. We could effectively put all of our video content on there.</span></p><p><strong><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);text-decoration: none;"><br/></span></strong></p><p><strong><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);text-decoration: none;">What analytics does it provide?</span></strong></p><ol><li style="list-style-type: decimal;"><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);text-decoration: none;">You can see if a HS contact has viewed a video from their timeline</span></p></li><li style="list-style-type: decimal;"><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);text-decoration: none;">You can segment HS contacts based upon what videos they have watched</span></p></li><li style="list-style-type: decimal;"><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);text-decoration: none;">You can see which videos help drive conversions</span></p></li><li style="list-style-type: decimal;"><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);text-decoration: none;">Provides heat mapping - how much and what parts of a video are being watched </span></p></li><li style="list-style-type: decimal;"><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);text-decoration: none;">See where users click on the video (annotations and CTA’s)</span></p></li><li style="list-style-type: decimal;"><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);text-decoration: none;">You can include videos within our emails campaigns</span></p></li><li style="list-style-type: decimal;"><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);text-decoration: none;">You can use smart-lists to identify and segment users into a workflow, for those who have watched a video 100% etc or by many times they’ve viewed it</span></p></li><li style="list-style-type: decimal;"><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);text-decoration: none;">You can run reports to see how HubSpot videos are performing, and how they affect conversion rates</span></p></li></ol><p><strong><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);text-decoration: none;"><br/></span></strong></p><p><strong><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);text-decoration: none;">SEO</span></strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);text-decoration: none;">Video SEO is when videos show up in Google in the form of </span><a class="external-link" href="https://developers.google.com/structured-data/rich-snippets/?hl=en" rel="nofollow" style="text-decoration: none;"><span style="color: rgb(17,85,204);text-decoration: underline;">rich snippets</span></a><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);text-decoration: none;"> results, where they would display a video thumbnail, making them better at generating traffic. Also, pages that host a video are more likely to get found in search engines because google ranks them higher.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);text-decoration: none;">However, these days video content is less frequently shown in search, and only the most credible websites or Youtube seem to get ranked. All of which can change at Google’s discretion.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);text-decoration: none;">The way you rank a video with SEO, is by using a sitemap and the correct keyword </span><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);text-decoration: none;">metadata for your video with descriptions and transcript information, all of which you can do with a Wistia account.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);text-decoration: none;">How would Blueberry use it?</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);text-decoration: none;">At the moment and to the best of my knowledge, Blueberry has only one promotional video for CMM, and a number of support videos for…</span></p><ol><ol><li style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);text-decoration: none;">Tutorial support videos (flashback and cmm)</span></p></li><li style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);text-decoration: none;">Thought leader videos (Martin)</span></p></li><li style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);text-decoration: none;">Webinars (potential area from CMM)</span></p></li></ol></ol><p><strong><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);text-decoration: none;"><br/></span></strong></p><p><strong><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);text-decoration: none;">Alternatives</span></strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);text-decoration: none;">YouTube and Vimeo are other options but don't integrate with HubSpot, but a Youtube player can work with Google Analytics:</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(153,51,0);text-decoration: none;">Dave Francis:</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(153,51,0);text-decoration: none;">I've been using Google Analytics 'events' on another product. Our JS sends an 'event' to GA, and we can use that in examining stats. Its very easy to use. If we sent an event from CMM when the video was played, we could compare the % of people that convert (to whichever goal) after watching the video to the % that don't watch it (as well as easily see how many played it).</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(153,51,0);text-decoration: none;">Maybe figure its effectiveness. If we find it significantly increases conversions, it might be worth considering getting a new movie for FB.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(153,51,0);text-decoration: none;">Or we could A-B test the page, one with video and one without. I'm very interested in using A-B testing and GA events to tune the FB site.</span></p><p><strong><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);text-decoration: none;"><br/></span></strong></p><p><strong><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);text-decoration: none;">Assessment</span></strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);text-decoration: none;">Wistia seems like a nice and useful addition to HS, but it's not something DD are pushing as crucial for CMM (at least), and it would cost us $3,600 per annum - for all domains.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);text-decoration: none;">Having the analytics described would be very productive for videos that encourage a signup, but at present these videos are in limited use, and the majority of videos are post-sale and support based.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);text-decoration: none;">If implemented now, Wistia could tell us how many sign-ups watched a video, and for how long before registering. We could then create a conversion rate for those that have watched a video, against those who didn’t, and base further video development around this.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);text-decoration: none;">However without any video metrics, it’s impossible to tell whether any of our existing videos make a difference to conversions. It may be useful to implement a youtube player as a pilot test (as Dave has suggested), and see how many sign-ups complete the goal of watching the video.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);text-decoration: none;">Or perhaps a faster option is implement Wistia for a limted time (maybe 2 -3 months), once the rate of sign-ups has increased (CMM, maybe not relevant to FB), and we can make more of an informed decision towards it’s permanent usage.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);text-decoration: none;">In CMM’s case, I would see further video content focusing on our target customer personas, and higher funnel content like webinars. Whereas for FB and consult, videos might be more generalised.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);text-decoration: none;">However, if we did implement Wistia on a permanent basis,  there’d have to be a greater focus on video development for a larger ROI, which would pull attention away from other areas such as content which forms our marketing backbone.</span></p><p><strong><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);text-decoration: none;"><br/></span></strong></p><p><strong><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);text-decoration: none;">Conclusion</span></strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);text-decoration: none;">In conclusion, video content does not seem to be as prominent as it once was in google search, but more than likely will still help web pages rank higher.</span><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);text-decoration: none;"> </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);text-decoration: none;">Additionally,because we don't have to many promotional videos at the moment (to my knowledge), Wistia is probably not worth the cost at present, but is perhaps something we should revisit after our text-based content marketing has truly taken effect. To where we can create videos targeted more towards our marketing personas, and integrate them into higher funneled-content workflows.</span></p>
