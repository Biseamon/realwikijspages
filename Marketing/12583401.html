<h1>Blueberry : Ch. 16 - A/B Testing&nbsp;</h1>

<h3><i>Creating an A/B test - HubSpot:</i></h3>
<p><i>&nbsp;</i><strong>1.&nbsp;Changing a HubSpot 'Website Page' into a 'Landing Page'&nbsp;:</strong></p>
<p><i><strong>&nbsp;</strong></i></p>
<ul>
  <li>To perform an A/B Test, your HubSpot page must be a 'Landing Page'.</li>
</ul>
<p>To change a website page into a landing page, find your page in 'Website Pages' &gt; click the dropdown menu for ‘more’ (located towards the far right) &gt; choose ‘Move to landing pages’.</p>
<p>A popup will then appear and state a condition of the move, if okay, press the ‘Move to Landing Pages’ button to finish.</p>
<p><br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;</i><strong>2. Setting up a HubSpot Landing Page A/B Test:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Click on your Landing Page (via 'Landing Pages) &gt; click 'Edit' &gt; click 'Settings' &gt; click 'Create and A/B Test' - give your variation a (easy and accurate) name &gt; click 'Okay'<ul>
      <li>This process also works if you've created a new Landing Page.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>After this change, you'll now see a green/blue 'A/B' icon next to the top-left text for 'Back to landing pages'.<ul>
      <li>Clicking either of these 'A' or 'B' buttons allows you to switch your view between either page.</li>
      <li>Essentially, treat each page as a seperate entitity, and make your specifc changes. To learn more about creating a landing page, please see the <a href="Ch.-9.1---Creating-a-Landing-Page_12583129.html">HubSpot Wiki.</a></li>
      <li><strong>Note</strong>, changes made to one page should not affect the other - unless it's a change to a global template module which your two pages share.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>To publish a variation, click the blue 'Publish' button on the top-right of each page.</li>
  <li>To stop or choose a variation winner, click on your Landing Page (via 'Landing Pages) &gt; click 'Variations' &gt; click 'Choose as winner'.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>&nbsp;</i><strong>3. Enabling Google Analytics A/B Tracking:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>To enable Google Analytics tracking, each variation will need a specific piece of code inserted into it's header.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li>
  <li>To do this for your 'A' page &gt; open you 'A' page and click 'Settings' &gt; click 'Edit HTML settings' &gt; insert '<strong>&lt;meta name="bbmarketing-abtest" content="A"&gt;</strong>' at the top of the entry box, and before any other code (if present).</li>
  <li>To do this for your 'B' page &gt; open you 'A' page and click 'Settings' &gt; click 'Edit HTML settings' &gt; insert '<strong>&lt;meta name="bbmarketing-abtest" content="B"&gt;</strong>' at the top of the entry box, and before any other code (if present).</li>
  <li>To remove this code, simply delete it from the header file.</li>
  <li>After 1-2 days (after GA has recorded some traffic), these results will show in GA with the end of their URL showing '<strong>/?abtest=A</strong>' and '<strong>/?abtest=A</strong>' respectively.<br>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Note</strong>, I would advise to only have this code implemented across one A/B test at a time. However, if you wish to run additional tests, I would contact Alex Putnam and ask him to adapt the code.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
