<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Information below is drawn from&nbsp;<a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/resources-and-support/data-protection-self-assessment/data-controllers/">https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/resources-and-support/data-protection-self-assessment/data-controllers/</a></p>
<p>The GDPR is intended to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>assist in the protection of people from abuses of their fundamental rights. This covers the rights to vote, equal treatment before the law, the right to privacy, and other EU-recognised fundamental rights and freedoms. Consider, for instance, the risks of a hypothetical extensive government CCTV use and a practice of police profiling based on ethnic origin.</li>
  <li>and also to extend certain new&nbsp;<a href="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/display/BLUEB/GDPR+-+Rights+Under+the+GDPR">rights</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to do this, the GDPR requires organisations to follow specific processes, backed up with very substantial fines.&nbsp;Previously, the highest fine the ICO could levy was £500,000. Under the GDPR they are able to issue fines up to 20 million euros or 4% of your global annual turnover (whichever is the higher).</p>
<h1><br>What data is covered?</h1>
<p>Only "personal" data is covered, but “personal” under the GDPR means “any information relating to an identifiable person”.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That definition is perhaps surprisingly broad. This means email addresses are often personal data&nbsp;<strong>even when in a business context</strong>. The email address&nbsp;<a href="mailto:duncan.forsyth@bbconsult.co.uk">duncan.forsyth@bbconsult.co.uk</a>&nbsp;is personal data. If there's only one salesperson, then&nbsp;<a href="mailto:sales@acme.com">sales@acme.com</a>&nbsp;<i>could</i>&nbsp;be deemed personal data.</p>
<p>And, "any information" means&nbsp;<i>any&nbsp;</i>information, not just the&nbsp;<i>identifying</i>&nbsp;information. The contents of a shopping basket&nbsp;<i>by itself</i>&nbsp;is not personal data, but as soon as we are able to connect the shopping basket to a name and delivery address it&nbsp;<i>becomes</i>&nbsp;personal data.</p>
<p><br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In theory, the name "John Smith" by itself, might not be personal data. But&nbsp;<i>practically</i>&nbsp;a name is never without context. e.g. "I spoke to John Smith in our cafe today".&nbsp;<i>Usually</i>&nbsp;a name plus a minimal amount of context is enough to identify a person.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>What is data processing?</h1>
<p>Data processing explicitly includes data storage and data access. This&nbsp;has particular importance when it comes to rules on international transfers.</p>
<p>If you are in China whilst accessing data hosted in the UK from a UK-hosted website, then the data has been processed in China.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Enforcement</h1>
<p>Hypothetically, at any time, the Information Commission Officer could choose to request the information asset register of every company that previously registered under the DPA, and fine everyone that doesn't provide that register.&nbsp;<strong>However</strong>,</p>
<ul>
  <li>the GDPR has a clear&nbsp;<i><u>focus</u></i>&nbsp;on large-scale operations such as government initiatives, Facebook, Google Ads, political profiling, etc.</li>
  <li>the EU want consistency of enforcement between countries, and such a move would very likely to be inconsistent.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is very unlikely that we'll be called upon to immediately provide our information asset register to the government. If it were requested, it seems unlikely that the content of the register will attract&nbsp;any significant degree of scrutiny.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, we have received "due diligence" requests from our larger customers. They shouldn't ask to see the register, but they may well ask to see our&nbsp;<a href="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/display/BLUEB/GDPR+-+Information+Security+Policy">Information Security Policy</a>. And we have received requests for&nbsp;<a href="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/display/BLUEB/GDPR+-+Processor-Controller+Contracts">controller-processor contracts</a>.</p>
<p>In the long term, the ICO is trying to foster an environment where companies' choose to publish their GDPR documentation. In theory, creating trust through transparency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Unavoidable requirements</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Documenting what processing activities we're engaged in, in&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfI4b86L_xfiJHOanHEFImY8hxMD1lhNZiT3RbhfYXY_YuHEw/viewform">a register</a></li>
  <li>Performing and documenting a&nbsp;<a href="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/display/BLUEB/GDPR+-+Short+Risk+Assessment"><i>short</i>&nbsp;risk assessmen</a>t against each of the identified activities</li>
  <li>Identifying and documenting the&nbsp;<a href="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/display/BLUEB/GDPR+-+Lawful+Basis+of+Activity">lawful basis</a>&nbsp;for each of the identified activities</li>
  <li>Very often, the lawful basis will be "legitimate interest" and will require documentation of a short&nbsp;<a href="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/display/BLUEB/GDPR+-+Legitimate+Interests+Assessment">legitimate interest assessment</a></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Avoidable requirements</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Registration with Information Commissioner's Office. There's no need to register if all the processing is for:<ul>
      <li>staff administration (including payroll)</li>
      <li>accounts or records (i.e. invoices and payment)</li>
      <li>advertising, marketing and public relations (of own company)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/display/BLUEB/GDPR+-+Data+Protection+Impact+Assessment">Data Protection Impact Assessments</a>. These are only required if the self-assessments indicate a high risk.</li>
  <li>Volunteering to the ICO the details of your processing. This is only required if you are unable to demonstrate to your own satisfaction that all risks have an appropriate mitigation. This is nearly inconceivable.</li>
  <li>If the lawful basis for an activity is "consent", which&nbsp;<i><strong>pragmatically should be avoided</strong></i>, then there's an enhanced process for consent management, covering: positive opt-in, withdrawal, separation from other terms and conditions, avoiding consent as precondition for service, record keeping of changes in consent, parental consent for children less than 13</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Information Asset Register</h1>
<p>For organisations with less than 250 employees, this covers any processing not done "<i>occasionally" .&nbsp;</i>There's been limited guidance for this word, but the Belgian DPA has declared it means "coincidental, unforeseen, or not usual".</p>
<p>For organisations with more than 250 employees, the information to be held in the register is more extensive, notably requiring:</p>
<ul>
  <li>retention schedules</li>
  <li>descriptions of security measures</li>
  <li>export to third countries</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Exemptions</h1>
<p>There are a considerable number of exemptions to the GDPR but we're unlikely to encounter most of them. Friends and colleagues may be interested in just a few:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Processing for personal use, by a person rather than an organisation is exempt.</li>
  <li>Processing that is only&nbsp;<i>occasional</i>&nbsp;by an organisation of fewer than 250, is&nbsp;<i>often</i>&nbsp;exempt.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Notably not exempt:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Processing by the self-employed</li>
  <li>Processing by hobby clubs (though they won't need to register with the ICO)</li>
</ul>
