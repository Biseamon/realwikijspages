Here’s your checklist! Here are a few BlueSprints things you should be doing, and this now applies to all projects, except those that are 95% completed e.g. MCA Control Room, Where’s Free.</strong><br/><strong> </strong><br/><strong>USE LEVEL 1 TO LEVEL 3 TASKS</strong><br/> <br/>Your Task Tree in PTS should have three levels. Level 1 Tasks are the customer’s requirements – the “what”, Level 2 Tasks are your design response to each requirement – the “how”. There may be one or more Level 2 Tasks for each Level 1. Level 3 Tasks are the work instructions for the developers. There may be one or more Level 3 Tasks per Level 2.<br/> <br/><strong>MAKE YOUR REQUIREMENTS “USER STORIES”</strong><br/> <br/>Level 1 Tasks are your requirements and they should typically be expressed in customer user language. Ideally they will be written by the customer, but sometimes they will be the result of a workshop session with the customer. Nevertheless, they should be in a format such as “I want a page where I can view and update information about any of my suppliers” or perhaps “The system must have a page for listing and editing suppliers”. The exact format is flexible but each requirement should be atomic, clear and complete.<br/> <br/><strong>IDENTIFY YOUR PRODUCT OWNER</strong><br/> <br/>You should identify which one person within the customer organisation owns the requirements. This is the Product Owner. It may or may not be the same person as the customer’s Project Manager. Really, it needs to be the person who the system is for and who can make executive decisions about what they want from the software. Examples would be Cliff at Uvex, Amelia at EE, David at Hudson, ? at RCO (interesting one – forces the customer to decide who is ultimately in charge of the spec!). You can set the Product Owner role in PTS the customer contact grid. Once set up, this person can see Tasks for approval in the Portal.<br/> <br/><strong>GET LEVEL 1 AND LEVEL 2 TASKS APPROVED BY THE CUSTOMER IN THE PORTAL</strong><br/> <br/>Firstly, make sure that you set up your customer with Portal access at the start of the project. This is a startup activity. As you create your requirements (Level 1 Tasks) and design (Level 2 Tasks) you should set the status to “WFCA” (Waiting For Customer Approval). These Tasks will then appear to the customer’s Product Owner in the Portal, where they can add comments and approve them.<br/> <br/>You don’t need to produce a spec document – unless the customer explicitly wants one, in which case we have a document template that can be used where an export of the Level 1 and 2 Tasks from PTS can be inserted.<br/> <br/><strong>MAKE A RISK LOG – AND CHECK IT WEEKLY!</strong><br/> <br/>Every project should have a Risk Log created at the start of the project and checked/updated weekly. We will be introducing a tool called PRISM soon to help you tease out where the project risks are. Remember that a Risk Log is totally useless unless you make an action plan to mitigate each risk – and review the Log and Actions weekly.<br/> <br/><strong>CREATE A DEVELOPMENT CATALOGUE</strong><br/> <br/>Once your Level 1 and Level 2 Tasks are approved by the Customer, you can create the corresponding Level 3 Tasks. These are the actual work packages for the developers. Each L3 Task should be small (max 2 days work) and well defined. You should agree an estimate with the developer that you are both happy with, erring on the pessimistic side. Each of these Tasks should then be set to status DCAT (Development Catalogue) so they are ready to be allocated to a Sprint.<br/> <br/><strong>PLAN OUT YOUR SPRINTS</strong><br/> <br/>Once your Development Catalogue is complete, it is ideal to plan out ALL of your Sprints. Of course, Sprints will change and new Sprints will be added as the project progresses, but by starting off with an initial set of planned Sprints, including all DCAT Tasks, you are effectively creating a project plan for the development work.<br/> <br/><strong>SET UP SPRINTS WITH A FIXED DURATION AND LEAVE 20% CONTINGENCY</strong><br/> <br/>Setting up a Sprint has these steps:-</p><ol><li>Decide the duration. The duration must be no more than 3 weeks. 1 or 2 weeks should be normal.</li><li>Identify what developer resources you have and their availability, taking into account holidays and their involvement in other work. This gives you a number of available developer hours.</li><li>Set at least 20% contingency in your Sprint.</li><li>Allocate Tasks from your Development Catalogue to the Sprint until all the available time is used (excluding the contingency).</li></ol><p><br/> <br/>Example:-</p><ol><li>My Sprint will be 2 weeks (10 working days)</li><li>I have two developers. There is a Russian bank holiday within the Sprint and one of my devs is needed for two days on another project. So that gives me 9 days for one developer, and 7 for the other. Total 16 days – 128 hours.</li><li>I set contingency at 20% so 26 hours is not available for allocating – it’s there for fixing problems, handling overruns etc.</li><li>I allocate Tasks to the Sprint to fill up the remaining 102 hours based on estimates I agreed with my devs.</li></ol><p><br/> <br/><strong>HAVE A DAILY REVIEW WITH YOUR DEVS AND UPDATE YOUR ESTIMATES</strong><br/> <br/>Each morning, talk to your devs on Skype. Focusing on the Tasks they are working on, ask them “What did you do yesterday?”, “What are you planning to do today?”, “Is the Task on target or are there any impediments requiring a re-estimate?”. Record progress against your estimates and this will feed into your Burndown Chart. Currently, we are using a spreadsheet for this but hopefully it will soon be possible to do this in PTS.<br/> <br/><strong>USE BURNDOWN CHARTS AND SHOW THEM IN THE TEAM STANDUP</strong><br/> <br/>By updating estimates with the devs every day, you will update your Burndown Chart. Show this in your Team Standup when reporting project progress on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Also, you can show it to your customer unless there is a good reason not to. In the future, it will be made available to the customer through the Portal.</p>
