<h1>Blueberry Group : New Issues / Tasks / Tickets Management Pages&nbsp;</h1>
<p>Created by Jason Cozza on Nov 24, 2020</p>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<hr>
<p>I think we need to do a big overhaul of tasks/issues management inside PTS - it is far too slow, and is&nbsp; wasting a lot of people's time.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>I think we should have merged issue+tickets+tasks page, so a PM can look through all items that need action on a project.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Users should be able to see a list of issues/tasks in an LHS panel, and then open the details in a right side panel - this should be much faster than switching to a new screen. &nbsp;Obviously it can be difficult to get everything on one screen, but wide-screens are common.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>We are potentialy standardising on Office 365, and maybe we could integrate with it more directly - this might make it easier to discuss PTS issues in outlook?</li>
</ol>
<h1>Previous Designs and Implementation</h1>
<hr>
<p>We have this google doc:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KoKEDLR3P6TGMSHyIdsV69MlWnkbu88FylY6haNcyU4/edit#heading=h.m1ppfmqbyw70">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KoKEDLR3P6TGMSHyIdsV69MlWnkbu88FylY6haNcyU4/edit#heading=h.m1ppfmqbyw70</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And the associated XLS:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="https://drive.google.com/a/bbconsult.co.uk/file/d/0BwrpSzy5Mr1HMEJaLU1DNG9WR28/view?ths=true">https://drive.google.com/a/bbconsult.co.uk/file/d/0BwrpSzy5Mr1HMEJaLU1DNG9WR28/view?ths=true</a>&nbsp;<br><br>We have new issues page here -&nbsp;<a href="http://ptsa.bbconsult.co.uk/#/issues">http://ptsa.bbconsult.co.uk/#/issues</a></p>
<h1>Review / Edit Issues without Opening New Window</h1>
<hr>
<p>I think the best idea is to have a dual mode screen. &nbsp;I open up the issues/tasks/tickets search screen, and I&nbsp; can perform filtered searches and see a big grid. &nbsp;I can use a tooltip to view more details. &nbsp; If I click the issue<br>title, the grid shrinks to only a few columns, and an editor panel appears on the right. &nbsp;I can now click on issues and they appear in the right hand side panel.</p>
<p>Another option: &nbsp;we display the detail window in a separate screen. &nbsp;Some BB people spend a lot of time reviewing issues, and they could have one smaller screen to show the issue list, another larger screen<br>to show the detail. &nbsp; To support this we'd need to have a special mode which can be enabled and saved to that PCs' cookies.&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Review Issues / Tasks / Tickets in One Screen</h1>
<hr>
<p>I think it's useful to have a single screen where I can see all issues and tasks for a project, and&nbsp; review / close them. &nbsp;The "issue editor" panel would change depending on which item is selected.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what issues this presents? &nbsp; I guess for issues / tasks do not have identical status values which may make filtering more complex?</p>
<h1>Implementation Approach</h1>
<hr>
<p>I suggest</p>
<ul>
  <li>We review and improve the new Angular issues screen, taking time to get it right - and thinking of it as a template for other screens to come<br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>We implement the dual mode with a dummy issue review panel, and see how this feels<br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>We then work on the full issue panel, so we can put this into general use<br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>The we do tasks screen and tasks panel<br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Then we create a merged tasks / issues screen</li>
</ul>
