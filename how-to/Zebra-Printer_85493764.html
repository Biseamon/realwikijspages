Note that we are using 3-inch continuous paper so set the dimensions to be 3 x (large enough number to contain all the printed data)</p><p>The current code is in BBWT.Web\app\directives\formApp\printForm.ts.</p><p>The conveyanceModeLayout() function generates a print template for the Conveyancing form. The code here is very rough and was written as just a proof-of-concept, and I’d recommend refactoring it into a base PrintTemplateWriter class (and ConveryanceNoteTemplateWriter sub-class) before doing anything else with it, because at the moment it’s specific to the conveyance note and doesn’t expose any functionality that could be shared with other forms. The base class would provide some functionality for generic formatting (like the bold() function does), and keep track of the x and y coordinates – although the structure of the ZPL language makes it hard to map to a nice OO API.</p><h1 id="ZebraPrinter-ZPL">ZPL</h1><p>The template is in a language called ZPL, which you can find a manual on here:  <a class="external-link" href="https://www.zebra.com/content/dam/zebra/manuals/en-us/software/zpl-zbi2-pm-en.pdf" rel="nofollow">https://www.zebra.com/content/dam/zebra/manuals/en-us/software/zpl-zbi2-pm-en.pdf</a>  it’s not a nice language and it doesn’t provide you with the things you expect – for example, to do bold text you need to print the same text three times in slightly different positions.  Something else to be aware of is that you have to set the vertical length of the printed data at the top of the form (with ^LL), but you probably won’t know this until you’ve finished generating the template.</p><h1 id="ZebraPrinter-PairingWithPrinter">Pairing With Printer</h1><p> Also: I’ve started moving the scan() functionality into BBWT.Web\app\services\formApp\PrintService.ts (not yet committed, but will be soon). If you find that you want to add more functionality into the print directive, it might make sense to put it into the PrintService instead.</p><p> </p>
