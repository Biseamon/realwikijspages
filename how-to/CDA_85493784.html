If no information about these markers is present in a lexicon CSV, it will default to English. These markers are easy to add to and typically semantic. ie: </p><ul><li><p class="auto-cursor-target">SHARED.BUTTONS.PROCEED.TITLE</p></li><li><p class="auto-cursor-target">equal to</p><div class="table-wrap"><table class="confluenceTable"><colgroup><col/></colgroup><tbody><tr><th class="confluenceTh">Proceed</th></tr></tbody></table></div></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Lexicons are uploaded in the UI per Client under Manage Clients &gt; Select Client to Edit &gt; Lexicons &gt; Upload<ul><li>Lexicons can also be downloaded from this location</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>The &quot;Clients&quot; each contain their own lexicon, subdomain and branding<ul><li>Branding determines the header logo, which if not specified would default to /Content/Images/cda-logo.png, logos should be 200x70 pixels</li><li>Branding also determines colour scheme</li><li>Subdomains for testing are in Route53, however the binding of subdomains is not determined by IIS, any domain can be associated with the server's Elastic IP<ul><li>If no client exists, this would resolve to the default site</li><li>If the client information contains the matching address used by the user, it will effectively &quot;redirect&quot;.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>There are 12 languages at present</li></ul><p>Reports:</p><ul><li>Reports can be produced as Word Documents or as PDF, PDF is preferred. This is handled by Docentric.<ul><li>Docentric was recently upgraded to V6.0<ul><li>This included a font component overhaul allowing for non-latin text</li></ul></li><li>Report designs are determined by a docx template with dynamic elements<ul><li>CDA will not modify these dynamic elements but will often decide to modify fixed elements which can cause alignment issues on occasion</li></ul></li><li>V6.0 seems to have a bug when dealing with JPEG elements<ul><li>The current workaround is that we use PNG images exclusively, CDA are aware of this.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>Minor fixed-element modifications:</p><ul><li>A small amount of inline CSS is specified in the index.cshtml file, this is a quick and dirty patch-job to sort out some styling issues.</li></ul>
