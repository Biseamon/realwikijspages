                    <div id="main-content" class="wiki-content group">
                    <p>This is what the Watchdog's Settings screen looks like :</p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" height="400" src="attachments/85493651/85493657.png" data-image-src="attachments/85493651/85493657.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="85493657" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="2016-05-11_11h12_48.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="85493651" data-linked-resource-container-version="1"></span><br/><em>Blueberry Outloot - Watchdog Settings Screen</em></p><p>First, as the plugin has originally been released for the support team, you can see options like &quot;<em>Support Hours</em>&quot; and &quot;<em>Support Days</em>&quot;. Do not worry, you can freely use this functionality without doing any support, here are all the explanations you may need about the different settings.</p><p>The Settings screen can be decomposed in 4 parts. I will do so to explain you each single setting of it.<br/> </p><p><strong>1) Popup Delays :</strong></p><p>The Popup delay part contains two numeric fields :</p><p> <span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" src="attachments/85493651/85493652.png" data-image-src="attachments/85493651/85493652.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="85493652" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="2016-05-11_11h21_05.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="85493651" data-linked-resource-container-version="1"></span><br/><em>  Settings Screen - Popup Delay Fields</em></p><p><strong>Popup delay</strong> represents the delay you allow to any email to be unanswered.<br/> Given this previous screenshot, the emails have up to 15 minutes to be answered. If no answer is received within this delay, a popup will appear to remind you to answer the email.</p><p><strong>Popup max delay</strong> stands for the maximum delay within which you want to be warned about any unanswered email.<br/>Basically, this setting should be useful only once a day since you are notified after 15 minutes. But in the case you just arrived at work, you may want to know what emails are critical within a larger amount of time.<br/>Given this previous screenshot, arriving at work at <strong>8:30</strong> and starting Outlook will let me know if an email has not been answered since <strong>8 o'clock</strong>.</p><p><u>NB</u>: If you disable then re-enable the watchdog, you'll be notified of all the emails unanswered within the last 30 minutes with this settings.<br/>       It is the same if you close re-open Outlook.</p><p><br/><strong>2) Support Time :</strong></p><p>The Support Time is made of the Support Hours and the Support Days :</p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" src="attachments/85493651/85493655.png" data-image-src="attachments/85493651/85493655.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="85493655" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="2016-05-11_11h17_01.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="85493651" data-linked-resource-container-version="1"></span><br/><em>                              Settings Screen - Support Hours &amp; Days</em></p><p><strong>Support Hours</strong> contains two masked fields :</p><ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li><strong>Start</strong> which corresponds to the starting watching time.</li><li><strong>Stop</strong> which corresponds to the end watching time.</li></ul><p>For instance, if I start Outlook at <strong>6 o'clock</strong> and a mail is unanswered, I will not be notified of it. The watchdog will wake up after <strong>8 o'clock</strong>.</p><p><strong>Support Days</strong> contains 7 check-boxes corresponding to the 7 days of the week.<br/>Again, if there are unanswered emails in days that are not ticked, you won't receive any notification.</p><p>These previous settings mean the watchdog will warn for any unanswered email between 8 am and 5:30 pm on working days only.</p><p><br/><strong>3) Filter List :</strong></p><p>The Filter List is composed of many controls :</p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" height="250" src="attachments/85493651/85493654.png" data-image-src="attachments/85493651/85493654.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="85493654" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="2016-05-11_11h17_14.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="85493651" data-linked-resource-container-version="1"></span><br/><em>Settings Screen - Filter List</em></p><p>You can notice a <strong>check-box</strong> next to &quot;Enable&quot; that let you enable/disable this setting whether you want (or not) to set a blacklist/white-list.<br/>You then have a <strong>combo-box</strong>  that let you choose between a blacklist and a white-list. It is up to you if you prefer to be warned on a few email addresses or on any address except a few.<br/>A <strong>text-box</strong> that let you type anything to add to the list. You then have to press the <strong>+</strong> <strong>button</strong> to add it to the list (If not already in).<br/>The <strong>- button</strong> removes the selected items of the list. You can select many and delete them all at once.<br/>A <strong>list-box</strong> containing all the strings that you want to filter.</p><p><u>NB:</u> This list is case-insensitive, no need to add noreply, NoReply, nORepLY [...]<br/>       Furthermore, it does not work on a full word match principle. Which means you can add &quot;noreply&quot; to stand for every single email address that would contain &quot;noreply&quot; (noreply@bbconsult.co.uk, noreply@google.com, noreply@confluence.bbconsult.co.uk, etc...).</p><p><br/><strong>4) Strings to look for :</strong></p><p>This list is almost like the previous one :</p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" height="250" src="attachments/85493651/85493653.png" data-image-src="attachments/85493651/85493653.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="85493653" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="2016-05-11_11h17_27.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="85493651" data-linked-resource-container-version="1"></span><br/><em>Settings Screen - Strings to look for</em></p><p>The content of the <strong>list-box</strong> is the strings that should appear in the <strong>TO or CC fields</strong> of your received emails. As soon as one single item of this list is found in one of these fields, the email is watchable, otherwise it is filtered.<br/>As the add-in was originally designed for the support team, this list contains &quot;support&quot;. It means that any email sent to any support email list (coloplast-support@blueberrysystems.co.uk, vtg-support@blueberrysystems.co.uk, blueberry-support@bbconsult.co.uk, etc...) is a valid one.<br/>Here, if an email is sent to every single person of the support team without the support mailing list in <em>To</em> or <em>CC</em> field, the add-in will not warn about the email if it turns to be unanswered.</p><p><u>Warning :</u></p><p>This filtering is based on the <strong>display names</strong> in <em>To</em> or <em>CC</em> fields. It means that if you specify something like &quot;martin.green@bbconsult.co.uk&quot;, the add-in may not work if the Sender has the email address in its contact with a full name like &quot;Martin Green&quot;.<br/>Considering this, I would advise you to put just &quot;martin&quot; in the list in this example.</p><p><u>NB:</u> This list is also case-insensitive, no need to specify all the possibilities like Martin, martin, mArTIn [...]<br/>       It is not working on a full word match principle either. Which means that &quot;support&quot; will stand for any entry containing &quot;support&quot; (coloplast-support@blueberrysystems.co.uk, Coloplast Support, insupportable@gmail.com, etc...).</p><p> </p><p><strong>Saving the Settings :</strong></p><p>Once you have entered your desired settings, you can either click the &quot;Cancel&quot; button to quit without saving anything or click &quot;OK&quot; to save it all.<br/><span style="line-height: 1.42857;">A verification of the different impossible cases is made before saving, for example, your max popup delay can not be less or equal to the popup delay.</span><br/><span style="line-height: 1.42857;">The Settings Screen let you type any </span><span style="line-height: 20.0px;">nonsense</span><span style="line-height: 1.42857;"> thing but will catch you up before saving.</span></p><p><span style="line-height: 1.42857;">There you can either read the error message and correct your mistake(s) or just click &quot;Cancel&quot; to leave without saving. </span></p><p><span style="line-height: 1.42857;">Once the settings saved (After clicking &quot;Ok&quot;) the watchdog cleans every former watched emails and immediately restarts one (if Enabled). Therefore you may directly have some popups after saving and do not forget the first scan will be based on the max delay in this case.</span></p>
