<h1>Blueberry Group : A Watchdog - What is that?&nbsp;</h1>
<p>Created by Jason Cozza on Nov 24, 2020</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is a simple feature that checks that certain emails are answered within a preset delay. If not, a notification (As a MessageBox) pops and warns you about any unanswered email.<br>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Here's a screenshot of a popup generated by Blueberry Outloot.</i><br><i>&nbsp;</i></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><br><i>If you click "Open" it opens the email so you can review and reply to it quickly if necessary.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><br><strong>Here are a few things that you have to know :</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>As it is an add-in, it may slightly&nbsp;slow down Outlook's startup.</li>
  <li>On startup, the add-in watches for all the unanswered mail within the max delay you specified in the settings.<br>So if you have just started your working day, you instantly know if anything requires your attention.</li>
  <li>The add-in creates a new tab to Outlook's homepage called "BLUEBERRY" which contains a group named "Watchdog" : there is one toggle button that enables/disables the add-in and one button to change its settings.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><br><strong>How it works :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The add-in looks through all the emails received within the delay you specified.<br>In these last emails, it checks that they are not blacklisted (Or that they are white-listed depending on your settings). Once done, it checks that the&nbsp;<i>To</i>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<i>CC</i>&nbsp;field contains at least one string specified in your settings.<br>If all those steps are validated then a timer starts and if it comes to the end, the MessageBox pops.<br>All along these steps, the add-in checks if the watched emails have been answered. As in Blueberry we always&nbsp;<i>reply to all</i>, the address that was contacted will also receive the answer and so the timer of the email will be stopped as soon as the add-in has detected the answer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">NB: You understand that an email is considered answered when any email that you receive is more recent and the former sender is now in To or CC field.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There is no check about the purpose of the email.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><br><strong>How to manage the Settings :</strong></p>
