          <h3>Brief History</h3>
        </td>
        <td colspan="1">Developed by Victor Simart.&nbsp;<br>This project started a simple request of some people in the office asking for a way to be warned when a customer email has not been answered within 15 minutes. Then, if a project manager notices one, it would mean support team is struggling and some of them may help us saying “I’m on this one”.&nbsp;<br>A few time after, Victor has been asked to create another plugin to help us with PTS which website’s a bit slow, so he added a simple interface to create these emails easily, based on customer emails.&nbsp;<br>Victor also has another feature to add, but he's not on it yet at all. He plans to try to do it as soon as possible.&nbsp;<br>Victor needed some webservice for the PTS feature as it needs to get the list of projects from the PTS. Talking with Oliver G., Martin G., Alex V. […] they wanted him to merge all of his features within their existing add-in. The thing is that they are using a huge library and merging both would make it all even bigger and slower and people here just &nbsp;wanted one simple feature.&nbsp;<br>So, Victor is developing his own version at the moment and will try to merge his features with their at the very end.</td>
