<h1>Blueberry Group : Prepare a new employee's laptop&nbsp;</h1>
<p>Created by Jason Cozza on Nov 24, 2020</p>
<p>This tuto is designed to help the setup of a new employee's laptop</p>
<h2>Windows Installation&nbsp;</h2>
<p>If the laptop is new , you can boot into the usb stick with the blueberry's iso image on it</p>
<p>when the installation process is ready , you will be able to create a new user, you can use his first name and his last name</p>
<p>For the moment, you don't need to create a password, the user will setup one later</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Windows configuration</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Updates</h3>
<p>You can now configure the wifi on this laptop and check for any updates, install every updates on this devices.</p>
<h3>Office tools (Word, Excel, Powerpoint)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Exit all your Office applications such as Outlook, Word, Excel, Powerpoint.</li>
  <li>Download o2019.zip ( <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KvDdFwFh7akKQg3TT5-7bIYHiPxjgmSg/view?usp=sharing">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KvDdFwFh7akKQg3TT5-7bIYHiPxjgmSg/view?usp=sharing</a>)&nbsp;(2GB download, 3GB when uncompressed, you need 10GB free space)</li>
  <li>From the Start menu, type File and open File Explorer</li>
  <li>Navigate to your Downloads folder. Confirm that you can see o2019.zip</li>
  <li>Double-click o2019.zip . Use the provided password. You should see the o2019 folder inside it.</li>
  <li>Select the o2019 folder and copy it by holding down the CTRL key&nbsp;and pressing C</li>
  <li>Select the Back or Up icons so that you return to the Downloads folder</li>
  <li>Paste the o2019 folder by holding down the CTRL key and pressing V</li>
  <li>The o2019 folder should now be inside the Downloads folder</li>
  <li>Start a command prompt (black window) by pressing the Windows key&nbsp;(start menu) and typing CMD then press the Return key.</li>
  <li>Type:</li>
</ul>
<p>cd Downloads
  cd o2019</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. If you just want Outlook, Word, Excel and Powerpoint:</p>
<p>setup.exe /configure</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Press RETURN at the end of the line. This should begin installation&nbsp;</p>
<p>immediately, with no need to wait to download anything else.</p>
<p>2. If you want Access as well as Outlook, Word, Excel and Powerpoint:</p>
<p>setup.exe /download configuration-access.xml
  setup.exe /configure configuration-access.xml</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Press RETURN at the end of each line. There will be a long wait&nbsp;</p>
<p>after the /download command, while it downloads Access. Nothing&nbsp;<br>will appear on the screen during this download. You can use Task&nbsp;<br>Manager to monitor network and storage activity.</p>
<p>3. If you want all the Office applications:</p>
<p>setup.exe /download configuration-all.xml
  setup.exe /configure configuration-all.xml</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When asked "Do you want to allow this application to make changes&nbsp;<br>to your device?" click YES.</p>
<p>This should then install Office 2019 for you.</p>
<p>If it complains that it cannot install 64-bit applications because&nbsp;<br>you have 32-bit applications installed, please uninstall your&nbsp;<br>32-bit Office applications manually, then rebooting. If this fails,&nbsp;<br>you can use the included SetupProd_OffScrub.exe program to&nbsp;<br>completely uninstall all Office applications, but be warned that&nbsp;<br>this may take an hour or more, and the program does NOT display any&nbsp;<br>progress (or indeed anything at all) for tens of minutes at a time&nbsp;<br>(you can view activity in Task Manager). We recommend trying to&nbsp;<br>manually uninstall 32-bit Office applications, and rebooting,&nbsp;<br>before using the SetupProd_OffScrub.exe tool as a last resort.</p>
<p>Once installed, Office will activate automatically with Blueberry's&nbsp;<br>Pro Plus 2019 Volume licence.</p>
<h3>Chrome</h3>
<p>Some employee like google chrome as a browser so you can download it using <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">this link&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>You can also download <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">firefox</a> if the employee prefer&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then you can install webroot using this <a href="http://downbox.webrootanywhere.com/wsasmeexe/SA9A-WRSM-574F-EF4F-3244.exe">link</a></p>
<p>If it ask you for a licence key, please use the key in the name of the file (for exemple:&nbsp;webroot_XXXYYYZZZ.exe the license key is&nbsp;XXXYYYZZZ)</p>

<p>Enable the bitlocker encryption process</p>
<p>follow these <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/how-use-bitlocker-encryption-windows-10">steps</a> (more informations are coming)</p>
