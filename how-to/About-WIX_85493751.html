                    <p>Wix is a tool set that allows you to create windows installers using XML format.</p><p>It has mainly two set of tools:</p><ol><li>The standard, which allows the creation of a normal installer.</li><li>And Burn or also named Wix Bootstrapper which allows bundling multiple installers together and chain install them.</li></ol><p>The standard has some descent tutorials and instruction to follow which can be found in the external resources of the Wix Documentation page: <a class="external-link" href="http://wixtoolset.org/documentation/" rel="nofollow">http://wixtoolset.org/documentation/</a></p><p>The bootstrapper can be a bit more tricky as not a lot of tutorial have been made and most of the instruction are going to be pointing to Wix actual installer's source code.</p><h1 id="AboutWIX-WixBootstrapper(WixBurn)">Wix Bootstrapper (Wix Burn)</h1><p><br/></p><p>The first thing to know about Wix's Bootstrapper is that it's separated in three parts:</p><ol><li>The bundle</li><li>The Bootstrapper / UI in c#</li><li>The Bootstrapper engine</li></ol><p>The bundle is where you will declare all your msi, the conditions regarding the machine and the <strong>bootstrapper to use</strong>.</p><p>Wix does provides some basic bootstrappers that can be used but they are really light and aren't much flexible.</p><p>If some more complex behavior are needed instead of what the basic bootstrappers Wix provides you will need to make a custom Bootstrapper.</p><p>All you need to do to create a bootstrapper is to have a class inherit from the abstract class &quot;BootstrapperApplication&quot; and you got your bootstrapper which also contains its engine. The BootstrapperApplication class is located in &quot;Microsoft.Tools.WindowsInstallerXml.Bootstrapper&quot; in the Microsoft.Deployment.WindowsInstaller.dll which is provided by Wix's SDK. </p><p>Your bootstrapper will have a range of event handler which can be categorized in three installation phases: Detection, Planning and Applying.</p><ul><li>The Detection phase is where the bootstrapper will look for the status of the future msi to install, if there are absent, present or need an update. This is where you will be able to populate your installer's UI with the correct values.</li><li>The Panning phase is where the bootstrapper will cash the msi and make a plan of what needs to be installed, uninstalled or repaired. This is where you will be able to choose if the installer will have to skip a certain msi based on some logic in your UI.</li><li>The Applying phase is where the bootstrapper does his magic and go thought the planning to execute the msi.</li></ul><p>Each of those need to be started by the engine by calling it's designated method ex: Bootstrapper.Engine.Detect().</p><p>The whole process of the bootstrapper really rely on calling those methods and handling the events which aren't well documented.</p><p>Some documentation can be found in the source code under src\burn\inc\IBootstrapperApplication.h which can be useful to know what return value you can use but most of the time you would just want to log the information that get passed though and work from there.</p><p>Finally here is a useful link to the most complete tutorial I found: <a class="external-link" href="http://www.wrightfully.com/part-1-of-writing-your-own-net-based-installer-with-wix-overview" rel="nofollow">http://www.wrightfully.com/part-1-of-writing-your-own-net-based-installer-with-wix-overview</a></p><p />
