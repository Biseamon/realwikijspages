                    <p> </p><p> </p><h3 id="FlashBackMarketingTasks-Immediatepriorities:"><strong>Immediate priorities:</strong></h3><p><strong><br class="Apple-interchange-newline"/>Business - Personal pricing</strong></p><div>The prices are decided, the pages are ready. We're waiting on changes from Oliver, a minor ones from Alex. Then we can make it live. Hopefully before the 14th. <span> <br/></span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div> </div><div><strong>Skype inbound campaign</strong></div><div>We were seeing very low conversion (to download) rates from the &quot;Record Skype&quot; ads, on Facebook and Adwords. I've stopped the Facebook ads for now and put their budget into Adwords, which were converting better. We've changed the landing page and made the ad keywords more targeted and this  has improved the rate, but not by a huge amount. We're surprised by this - the ads are targetted and the page relevant. Matt is making one more revision of the page, and I'll work on the keywords again when we have more data.</div><div><span> </span></div><div> </div><div><strong>Next inbound campaign</strong></div><div>Matt has suggested &quot;Flipped classroom&quot;. We can reuse text already written by Anna for the landing page, which Matt will start on very soon. Facebook ads may get better returns this time - we should be able to target educators  using their system, which is not possible using adwords.</div><div><span> </span></div><div> </div><div><strong>Application improvements</strong></div><div>- FB UI</div><div>The main change we're working on is to give a consistent 'home' screen for FB. When FB starts, we show a 'Welcome' screen with links to tutorials, recent movies and to 'Record the screen'. But the user never returns to this. Other screen recorders have a similar screen that the user is returned to after closing the Recorder. Were still working on a new design that displays Help, Recordings and feels like a genuine improvement over the current one. Other changes to the region and window recording UI, 'inspired' by other recorders, are already designed. </div><div><span> <br/></span><span> </span>- Tutorials</div><div>As part of the UI changes, we plan to make a few single page tutorials on basic tasks. A page, in Hubspot will be far easier to maintain than a movie.</div><div> </div><div>- Improved upsell from Express</div><div>This is a top priority for October. Currently we make no effort to upsell Express users on Plus/Pro, so even if we only succeed with a very small fraction it could represent a significant rise in sales. A first attempt at implementing this was unsuccessful, but the second try is looking good. We should be there before the 22nd.</div><div><span>  <br/></span></div><div><br/><strong>Email campaigns</strong></div><div>When the Business-person pricing is in place, we'll change the Pro/Plus email campaigns to send a discount on day 3. Mark has suggested Pro Business -&gt; $69 and Personal -&gt; $29. Ok.</div><div><br/>We will also start to email Express users, pushing Pro/Plus (no discount). Currently we don't push Express downloaders into HS, but it should be simple for Oliver to do this. We can filter out &gt;90% of them in HS and there should still be enough to get data on email clicks, and whether visitors from the email buy.</div><div> </div><div> </div><div><strong>More inbound marketing</strong></div><div>Matt is keen to get a blog running (in Hubspot), using an agency to write articles based on briefs from ourselves. The content can be reused and linked from social media. We have 4 themes we'd like to start with and Matt is getting prices.</div><div> </div><div> </div><div><strong>Remarketing ads</strong></div><div>We've stalled on this a bit. We had images, but they needed improving. I'd looked into running a remarketing campaign in adwords. Once we have a set of images, then we should be able to get some ads going soon.</div><div><span> </span></div><div> </div><div><strong>FBX</strong></div><div>John seems to have cracked the crash problem. Victor is working on one more set of improvements, and then its out to BB staff. I've been working on UI, don't have anything I'm entirely happy with yet, but we need to move on, so it may be a 'v1' for the beta. Matt has got a download/landing page designed. I have a design doc outlining things like account creation, UI, how we implement beta and trials, what websites we need, that John has been reading and commenting on. There's a lot for him to do and I hope he can get good focus on this for the rest of the year.</div><div> </div><h3 id="FlashBackMarketingTasks-ForLater:">For Later:</h3><div> </div><div><strong>Affiliates</strong></div><div>I know some people are cold on affiliates, but we're keen to see if we can test the water because its another option we've never tried.</div><div><span> </span></div><div>We're faced with the choice of either going with an existing affiliate network or making our own. Using an existing network should get us more affiliates, quickly, but will take a %. We've already done most of the work for tracking sales for resellers, so much of the work in creating our own network is in the sales reporting, settlements. This could be a fair sized task though. The approach we've suggested before is to try a network, to see if we get anything. If we do, we can consider making our network. If not, leave it. </div><div><span> </span></div><div>We've also wondered about an 'affiliate-lite' kind of approach, targetting Youtube users. We have a &quot;Make money from your Youtube videos&quot; campaign, with banners on the site, emails, social media. They sign up, get a unique URL to post in the description of their video. When someone downloads and purchases off that URL, they get a payment. We give them a basic page to track downloads, sales. By not saying &quot;this is an affiliate system&quot;, we're wondering if we can reduce the requirements, but settlements to the affiliates may be difficult.</div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><strong>Store</strong></div><div><span>Less urgent since we've improved the exit rate from the final step of the purchase process, but would still like to try a single page purchase process for FB, using the new iframe-less Braintree API.<br/></span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><strong>TA</strong></div><div><span>Reduce to one edition. Reduce price in line with FB. Bring it into the main site. </span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><strong>FB Trial period</strong></div><div><span>Trials are generally 30 days, but Movavi go for a shorter 7 days. Pros for a shorter period: you can send that 'last chance discount' mail sooner, and you may reduce the number of people that get what they want from FB just via the trial (we've increased the watermark size recently though). Cons: some users don't get the chance to use FB within 7 days and will need to ask for extension of their trial licence. </span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><strong>Licence-less <br/></strong></div><div><span>We use a system that sends a licence to the user to confirm their email address. After one day of trial (or immediately, with Express) the user needs to enter the licence key we emailed them the day before, to use FB again. None of our competitors that I'm aware of use a system like this. Camtasia collects an email address for marketing, but they don't send a licence to it. About 2/3 of Pro licences and 3/4 of Plus licences we send out are never entered into FB, so that's 2/3 and 3/4 of installations that cannot be used beyond the first day. This looks like something we can improve on. At the very least, we could give users a longer 'licence-less' period. What we're trying to improve here is engagement with FB, so the stats we can watch are those on the number of times recorder and player are run, and movies recorded. <br/></span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><strong>Localisation</strong></div><div><span>To prove or disprove the &quot;sell cheap in populous low-income countries&quot; theory, we </span></div><div><span>  - Translate the website or main pages into Russian. How that's best implemented is to be figured out. I'm hoping we can do something using simple subfolders in HS, so we don't need to purchase a translation management system.<br/></span></div><div><span>  - Mark wants to set prices for FB-Russian lower? Ok. </span></div><div><span>  - We could add a lower priority task for Oliver to look at adding <span style="color: rgb(33,33,33);"><a class="external-link" href="https://money" rel="nofollow">https://money</a>.</span><span style="color: rgb(33,33,33);">ru </span>or <span style="color: rgb(33,33,33);"><a class="external-link" href="https://www.webmoney.ru/" rel="nofollow">https://www.webmoney.ru/</a> <br/></span><br/></span></div><div><span><br/></span></div>
