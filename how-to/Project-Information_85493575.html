<p><br><br><strong>From:</strong> Andrew Oakley<br><strong>Sent:</strong> 22 June 2015 11:05<br><strong>Subject:</strong> Hudson deployment checklist and long-term deployment plan<br><br>As you know we have been having trouble with deployments to live with Hudson, and Alex, Nikolay and especially Hudson have been finding this frustrating. This is a separate issue to coding bugs. It’s perfectly understandable that a human being will make mistakes, so I am making a plan to reduce these mistakes (and reduce the frustration!).<br><br>The plan is:<br>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>Make a list of manual deployment steps – Nikolay</li>
  <li>Review the list, make corrections, add in missing parts - Alex</li>
  <li>Use the list to manually put the system live – Nikolay</li>
  <li>For any bugs found after go-live, keep updating the list – Nikolay and Alex</li>
</ol>
<p><br>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>Write automated scripts to perform as many parts of the list as possible (Jenkins? PowerShell?) – Nikolay</li>
  <li>Review the scripts, makes corrections, add in missing parts – Alex</li>
  <li>Use the scripts to automatically or semi-automatically put the system live</li>
  <li>Keep updating the scripts – Nikolay and Alex</li>
  <li>Eventually… fully automatic deployment! ;-)</li>
</ol>
<p><br>&nbsp;<br><br>I estimate stages 1-3 should take about 2-5 days – Nikolay, Alex, are you okay with doing this work this &amp; next week?<br><br>We then gradually move towards steps 5-8 over the next 1-3 months.<br><br>We arrive at step 9 – fully automated deployment - in 3-6 months. Nikolay, Alex, does that sound reasonable?<br><br>I suggest Nikolay writes this list on the BB Wiki so that we can all review and edit.</p>

<h1>Blueberry Group : AutoDeploy&nbsp;</h1>
<p>Created by Jason Cozza on Nov 24, 2020</p>
<p>A Windows application connected to PTS and Amazon S3 and can automatically install a new website version on a server. Once it detects a new web site version committed to PTS (and added to Amazon), the service receives a notification that a new version was released, downloads it from Amazon and installs/updates the current machine. If necessary, it also updates the database.</p>

        <td colspan="1">Developed by Victor Simart.&nbsp;<br>This project started a simple request of some people in the office asking for a way to be warned when a customer email has not been answered within 15 minutes. Then, if a project manager notices one, it would mean support team is struggling and some of them may help us saying “I’m on this one”.&nbsp;<br>A few time after, Victor has been asked to create another plugin to help us with PTS which website’s a bit slow, so he added a simple interface to create these emails easily, based on customer emails.&nbsp;<br>Victor also has another feature to add, but he's not on it yet at all. He plans to try to do it as soon as possible.&nbsp;<br>Victor needed some webservice for the PTS feature as it needs to get the list of projects from the PTS. Talking with Oliver G., Martin G., Alex V. […] they wanted him to merge all of his features within their existing add-in. The thing is that they are using a huge library and merging both would make it all even bigger and slower and people here just &nbsp;wanted one simple feature.&nbsp;<br>So, Victor is developing his own version at the moment and will try to merge his features with their at the very end.</td>

<h1>Blueberry Group : A Watchdog - What is that?&nbsp;</h1>
<p>Created by Jason Cozza on Nov 24, 2020</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is a simple feature that checks that certain emails are answered within a preset delay. If not, a notification (As a MessageBox) pops and warns you about any unanswered email.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493648/85493650.png"></figure>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Here's a screenshot of a popup generated by Blueberry Outloot.</i><br><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493648/85493649.png"></figure>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><br><i>If you click "Open" it opens the email so you can review and reply to it quickly if necessary.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><br><strong>Here are a few things that you have to know :</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>As it is an add-in, it may slightly&nbsp;slow down Outlook's startup.</li>
  <li>On startup, the add-in watches for all the unanswered mail within the max delay you specified in the settings.<br>So if you have just started your working day, you instantly know if anything requires your attention.</li>
  <li>The add-in creates a new tab to Outlook's homepage called "BLUEBERRY" which contains a group named "Watchdog" : there is one toggle button that enables/disables the add-in and one button to change its settings.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><br><strong>How it works :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The add-in looks through all the emails received within the delay you specified.<br>In these last emails, it checks that they are not blacklisted (Or that they are white-listed depending on your settings). Once done, it checks that the&nbsp;<i>To</i>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<i>CC</i>&nbsp;field contains at least one string specified in your settings.<br>If all those steps are validated then a timer starts and if it comes to the end, the MessageBox pops.<br>All along these steps, the add-in checks if the watched emails have been answered. As in Blueberry we always&nbsp;<i>reply to all</i>, the address that was contacted will also receive the answer and so the timer of the email will be stopped as soon as the add-in has detected the answer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">NB: You understand that an email is considered answered when any email that you receive is more recent and the former sender is now in To or CC field.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There is no check about the purpose of the email.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><br><strong>How to manage the Settings :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you want to know more about the Settings, please follow the link to the related article : <a href="Watchdog---Settings-Screen_85493651.html">Watchdog - Settings Screen</a>.</p>

<h1>Blueberry Group : Watchdog - Settings Screen&nbsp;</h1>
<p>Created by Jason Cozza on Nov 24, 2020</p>
<p>This is what the Watchdog's Settings screen looks like :</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493651/85493657.png"></figure>
<p><br><i>Blueberry Outloot - Watchdog Settings Screen</i></p>
<p>First, as the plugin has originally been released for the support team, you can see options like "<i>Support Hours</i>" and "<i>Support Days</i>". Do not worry, you can freely use this functionality without doing any support, here are all the explanations you may need about the different settings.</p>
<p>The Settings screen can be decomposed in 4 parts. I will do so to explain you each single setting of it.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1) Popup Delays :</strong></p>
<p>The Popup delay part contains two numeric fields :</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493651/85493652.png"></figure>
<p><br><i>&nbsp; Settings Screen - Popup Delay Fields</i></p>
<p><strong>Popup delay</strong> represents the delay you allow to any email to be unanswered.<br>Given this previous screenshot, the emails have up to 15 minutes to be answered. If no answer is received within this delay, a popup will appear to remind you to answer the email.</p>
<p><strong>Popup max delay</strong> stands for the maximum delay within which you want to be warned about any unanswered email.<br>Basically, this setting should be useful only once a day since you are notified after 15 minutes. But in the case you just arrived at work, you may want to know what emails are critical within a larger amount of time.<br>Given this previous screenshot, arriving at work at <strong>8:30</strong>&nbsp;and starting Outlook will let me know if an email has not been answered since <strong>8 o'clock</strong>.</p>
<p><u>NB</u>: If you disable then re-enable the watchdog, you'll be notified of all the emails unanswered within the last 30 minutes with this settings.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It is the same if you close re-open Outlook.</p>
<p><br><strong>2) Support Time :</strong></p>
<p>The Support Time is made of the Support Hours and the Support Days :</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493651/85493655.png"></figure>
<p><br><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Settings Screen - Support Hours &amp; Days</i></p>
<p><strong>Support Hours</strong> contains two masked fields :</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Start</strong> which corresponds to the starting watching time.</li>
  <li><strong>Stop</strong>&nbsp;which corresponds to the end watching time.</li>
</ul>
<p>For instance, if I start Outlook at <strong>6 o'clock</strong>&nbsp;and a mail is unanswered, I will not be notified of it. The watchdog will wake up after <strong>8 o'clock</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Support Days</strong> contains 7 check-boxes corresponding to the 7 days of the week.<br>Again, if there are unanswered emails in days that are not ticked, you won't receive any notification.</p>
<p>These previous settings mean the watchdog will warn for any unanswered email between 8 am and 5:30 pm on working days only.</p>
<p><br><strong>3) Filter List :</strong></p>
<p>The Filter List is composed of many controls :</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493651/85493654.png"></figure>
<p><br><i>Settings Screen - Filter List</i></p>
<p>You can notice a <strong>check-box</strong> next to "Enable" that let you enable/disable this setting whether you want (or not) to set a blacklist/white-list.<br>You then have a <strong>combo-box</strong>&nbsp; that let you choose between a blacklist and a white-list. It is up to you if you prefer to be warned on a few email addresses or on any address except a few.<br>A <strong>text-box</strong> that let you type anything to add to the list. You then have to press the&nbsp;<strong>+</strong>&nbsp;<strong>button</strong> to add it to the list (If not already in).<br>The&nbsp;<strong>- button</strong>&nbsp;removes the selected items of the list. You can select many and delete them all at once.<br>A <strong>list-box</strong>&nbsp;containing all the strings that you want to filter.</p>
<p><u>NB:</u>&nbsp;This list is case-insensitive, no need to add noreply, NoReply, nORepLY [...]<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Furthermore, it does not work on a full word match principle. Which means you can add "noreply" to stand for every single email address that would contain "noreply" (noreply@bbconsult.co.uk, noreply@google.com, noreply@confluence.bbconsult.co.uk, etc...).</p>
<p><br><strong>4) Strings to look for :</strong></p>
<p>This list is almost like the previous one :</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493651/85493653.png"></figure>
<p><br><i>Settings Screen - Strings to look for</i></p>
<p>The content of the <strong>list-box</strong>&nbsp;is the strings that should appear in the <strong>TO or CC fields</strong> of your received emails. As soon as one single item of this list is found in one of these fields, the email is watchable, otherwise it is filtered.<br>As the add-in was originally designed for the support team, this list contains "support". It means that any email sent to any support email list (coloplast-support@blueberrysystems.co.uk, vtg-support@blueberrysystems.co.uk, blueberry-support@bbconsult.co.uk, etc...) is a valid one.<br>Here, if an email is sent to every single person of the support team without the support mailing list in <i>To</i> or <i>CC</i> field, the add-in will not warn about the email if it turns to be unanswered.</p>
<p><u>Warning :</u></p>
<p>This filtering is based on the <strong>display names</strong> in <i>To</i> or <i>CC</i> fields. It means that if you specify something like "martin.green@bbconsult.co.uk", the add-in may not work if the Sender has the email address in its contact with a full name like "Martin Green".<br>Considering this, I would advise you to put just "martin" in the list in this example.</p>
<p><u>NB:</u>&nbsp;This list is also case-insensitive, no need to specify all the possibilities like Martin, martin, mArTIn&nbsp;[...]<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It is not working on a full word match principle either. Which means that "support" will stand for any entry containing "support" (coloplast-support@blueberrysystems.co.uk, Coloplast Support, insupportable@gmail.com, etc...).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Saving the Settings :</strong></p>
<p>Once you have entered your desired settings, you can either click the "Cancel" button to quit without saving anything or click "OK" to save it all.<br>A verification of the different impossible cases is made before saving, for example, your max popup delay can not be less or equal to the popup delay.<br>The Settings Screen let you type any&nbsp;nonsense&nbsp;thing but will catch you up before saving.</p>
<p>There you can either read the error message and correct your mistake(s) or just click "Cancel" to leave without saving.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the settings saved (After clicking "Ok") the watchdog cleans every former watched emails and immediately restarts one (if Enabled). Therefore you may directly have some popups after saving and do not forget the first scan will be based on the max delay in this case.</p>

<h1>Blueberry Group : Outloot Installation Steps&nbsp;</h1>
<p>Created by Jason Cozza on Nov 24, 2020</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">First, download the installer by clicking the following link : &lt;NoLinkYet&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Your folder should contain this :</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493658/85493661.png"></figure>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><br><i>Blueberry Outloot installation</i> folder.<br><br>Please, be sure to close Outlook before installing the add-in. You can uninstall any precedent version if you want (Control Panel &gt; Programs and Features &gt; BlueberryOutloot) but new versions should erase any former one.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Launch the setup by double-clicking on it.<br>The installer may need an internet access to validate the certificate so you may be issuing problems if you are not connected to the Internet.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493658/85493660.png"></figure>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><br><i>This is the normal certificate validation message that you should have.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just click the&nbsp;<i>Install</i> button to install the add-in.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The add-in should be running as soon as you will start Outlook. You can check by looking for the new tab called "BLUEBERRY" on Outlook's homepage.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493658/85493659.png"></figure>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>The new tab created by the add-in.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><br>NB: If you think the add-in may not be running, here is how to check its current state :<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Go to File &gt; Options &gt; Customize Ribbon and tick "Developer" in the right list.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Click the new tab "DEVELOPER" that appeared on your homepage.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Click "COM Add-Ins"<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Check that "BlueberryOutloot" is ticked in the list.</p>

<h1>Blueberry Group : GDManager&nbsp;</h1>
<p>Created by Jason Cozza on Nov 24, 2020</p>
<p>The google drive manager is the core object which contains all of the file and folder information.</p>
<h2>Instruction:</h2>
<p>Once the environment is set up call the connect function in function.py which will return the service (the client_secret.json need to be in the same folder as function.py).</p>
<p>Then create a new GDManager by passing the service object and the email of the owner of the drive.</p>
<p>On creation, the GDManager will get all files and folder information from google drive and then start drawing their paths.</p>
<p>Once GDManager has finish initialising you can call its sort method to have it sort all the files and folder in different dictionaries.</p>
<p>The Dictionaries are written as so: {“file/folder ID”: file/folder Object}</p>

<h1>Blueberry Group : Python script which cleans-up directories&nbsp;</h1>
<p>Created by Jason Cozza on Nov 24, 2020</p>
<p>by Nethmin S, 19 Jul 2018&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I came here for work experience Martin gave some tasks to complete during the time I was here, one of which was to write a python script which cleans-up directories.</p>
<p>I finished it half-way through my second week here. This is the script, imporvements are always welcome.</p>
<p>The script can delete files based on size, extension, rename files with the same double extension, and delete files based on their last accessed date or last date of modification.</p>
<p>Currently it also has an automatic mode where it deletes files based on preset values, which it tells the user before-hand.</p>
<p>(I'm currently writing this in the midst of testing the script)</p>
<p>edit: The indents havn't gotten copied over to the article but they should be on this computer in the VS Code file which contains the original code.</p>
<p>Credit to Asghar for helping me with this, ("He wrote the double extension fixing bit, which is why its really looks more complex")</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>#This is a python script written in order to clean up directories by deleting files with specific extensions, 0 KB files, renaming files with the same double extension<br>#It also deletes files which are three years or older (this is done by looking at the last time of moification and last time of access).</p>

<h1>Blueberry Group : Screenshot System&nbsp;</h1>
<p>Created by Jason Cozza on Nov 24, 2020</p>
<p>The tool allows a user to capture screenshots and create an interactive demo (a number of HTML files containing the images) as well as to export it to wiki. Shift+PrtScr is used to take screenshots. You can then change the order of the captured screens and add buttons to move to other screenshots. To be able to export to Wiki, you need to change settings in the settings.json file from the application directory,</p>

<h1>Blueberry Group : Sensor Tag&nbsp;</h1>
<p>Created by Jason Cozza on Nov 24, 2020</p>
<h2>Task:</h2>
<p>Make a reminder to keep a leg elevated using a sensor tag as well as a Raspberry PI.</p>
<h2>Location:</h2>
<p><a href="https://svn.bbconsult.co.uk/repository/amp_sensor/trunk">https://svn.bbconsult.co.uk/repository/amp_sensor/trunk</a></p>
<h2>Requirement:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Material: Sensor Tag and Raspberry PI</li>
  <li>Raspberry Pi needs mgp123 installed.</li>
  <li>Package: requirement file can be found it SVN</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instruction:</h2>
<p>Run “is_foot_up.py” and passing in the args: The Sensor tag mac address, number of iteration to calibrate and margin at which the foot is considered to be down.</p>
<h2>Result:</h2>
<p>Result can be seen on this video: <a href="https://flashbackconnect.com/Movie.aspx?id=c7lrdLPrZAa5yGMeVAeELw2">https://flashbackconnect.com/Movie.aspx?id=c7lrdLPrZAa5yGMeVAeELw2</a></p>
<h2>Problem encounter:</h2>
<p>The gyro values were ignored because even while not moving it reported some movement. And a calibration could not be properly made because this “noise” varies too much to be taken into account and subtracted from the final result.</p>

<h1>Blueberry Group : Blueberry Sleep Monitor Tool&nbsp;</h1>
<p>Created by Jason Cozza on Nov 24, 2020</p>
<p>This is a tool for monitoring and logging machine inactivity. It runs as a background task and sends usage stats off to a server which can be used to determine the amount of inactivity for a particular machine. It could for example be used to determine which machines should be turned off which would help to save power.</p>

<h1>Implement Performance Monitoring Tools</h1>
<p>We'd like to test NewRelic, AWStats, Jairo's SQL Monitoring Scripts and Anthony Mint's code on PTS.</p>
<h1>Holiday Request</h1>
<p>We have a suggestion to create a Holiday Request Form in PTS&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>User enters preferred holiday period</li>
  <li>System then puts holiday onto approval screen for PM</li>
  <li>When holiday is approved, we use Exchange API to add to shared calendar for the employee’s company</li>
</ol>
<p>To think about</p>
<ol>
  <li>We have timesheet approvals.&nbsp; I think this should be generalized to “approvals”</li>
  <li>HR should explain holiday approval rules to Oliver</li>
  <li>Shared calendar update may only be for UK people.&nbsp; I think BB Systems has separate calendar to Consult?</li>

<h1>Expenses / allowance approval</h1>

  <li>Form on PTS for sysadmin to register new person</li>
  <li>Enter email address of new person</li>
  <li>We send email to user welcoming them to BB, and requesting they create a password</li>
  <li>They enter password, and this is written to LDAP via API</li>
</ol>
<p>he reason is to avoid sending new user passwords within BB email – it’s a security improvement. I’m sure the registration form would be extended to capture other data…</p>

<p>The last time, when Alex Vickery worked on AD, we get service working on simple site.&nbsp;But, it was a long time ago. We need to review results again and do more tests.<br>The problem is that testers can't do testing. We need to have set of builds which can be used on testing.I planned to do:</p>
<ul>
  <li>create demo project (already have it in SVN)</li>
  <li>prepare set of builds which can be used for testing (valid and broken, to test error installations)</li>

<h1>Blueberry Group : Mini Project Features&nbsp;</h1>
<p>Created by Jason Cozza on Nov 24, 2020</p>
<h1>Mini Project Concept</h1>
<hr>
<p>Sysadmins don’t use PTS, nor does Marketing. &nbsp;They find it too clunky and complex. &nbsp;A lot of this is because PTS is slow - if we fix issue editor screens, we can improve this.</p>
<p>But Sysadmins and Marketing have other issues – they have lots of mini projects, for&nbsp;example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Migrate Exchange to 365</li>
  <li>Fix LDAP Security</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem is that creating each one of these as a PTS project requires loads of&nbsp;fields that&nbsp; aren't required. &nbsp;And these mini projects are too small to really get their&nbsp;own project ID.</p>
<p>Really we&nbsp;need a concept of a mini project.<br><br>My thinking is that we should make it so that individual tasks can be Mini Projects – we promote a task to be a mini project, and then maybe some extra fields appear.</p>
<p>We can then add extra screens to PTS to show all the mini projects by some criteria.</p>
<p>Question: &nbsp;can we have mini projects at any point in the tree? &nbsp; I don’t know. &nbsp;If we allow Mini Projects to exist at lower tree levels, then we can use the hierarchy to organise them - so we can have a collection of security tasks. &nbsp;But this does make it a lot more complex.</p>
<p>I'd probably say that mini projects can't contain other mini projects, and any folders above a mini project must be just a container. &nbsp;But it needs more thought</p>
<p>Mini Projects would exist within a normal PTS project, so we might have a PTS project for Sysadmin, one for PTS, and one for BBWT - each including a list of significant mini projects.</p>
<h1>Project Groups</h1>
<hr>
<p>Are mini projects another way of doing project groups? &nbsp; At present, a PTS project is completely standalone. &nbsp;This quite often gives us a problem: &nbsp;if we get two related projects from customer - which share code and timescales - it feels wrong to put them into two different projects. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe Mini Projects could fix this - we could have a project called BIMS with mini or subprojects of EOBS and Core?</p>
<h1>What do we do with Mini Projects</h1>
<hr>
<p>The main thing that mini projects allows is for us to make a list of all current mini projects, perhaps with an owner, and some idea of time left or completion date</p>
<figure class="table">
  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <th>Mini Project</th>
        <th>In Project</th>
        <th>Owner</th>
        <th>Target Completion Date</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Exchange Migration</th>
        <th>Systems</th>
        <th>Asghar</th>
        <th>1st October 2016</th>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</figure>
<p>I suppose Mini Projects would also gain other features of big projects, but I'm not sure exactly which yet&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.png" alt="(smile)"></figure>
<p>One idea is to publish mini project details to the wiki?</p>
<h1>Dependencies / Multiple Parents</h1>
<hr>
<p>PTS at present has a strict hierarchy which is currently used to model the functional breakdown of tasks and dependency. &nbsp;This is a bit limited compared to other tools<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This becomes more important when using PTS for syadmin tasks, because it's more likely there will be common dependencies between mini projects. &nbsp;If two projects are dependent on one common task, we can't represent this in PTS properly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The big question is how exactly to present this in the UI? &nbsp;UIs to represent tree structures that support multiple parents are very hard to do well - users struggle to know how to delete one parent, for example.</p>
<p>Options:<br>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>We have a simple system: &nbsp;a mini project can be linked to multiple tasks elsewhere in the containing project as dependent tasks, but this isn't in the tree as such<br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>We allow a task from another mini project to be dragged into the tree and it appears with a shortcut icon. &nbsp;Note that marking the imported task in this way means that each task actually has one real parent and inbound links from other places. &nbsp;This may simplify the logic a bit.<br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Maybe we only allow mini projects to be dependent on other mini projects. &nbsp;This feels too limited.</li>

<h1>Blueberry Group : New Issues / Tasks / Tickets Management Pages&nbsp;</h1>
<p>Created by Jason Cozza on Nov 24, 2020</p>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<hr>
<p>I think we need to do a big overhaul of tasks/issues management inside PTS - it is far too slow, and is&nbsp; wasting a lot of people's time.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>I think we should have merged issue+tickets+tasks page, so a PM can look through all items that need action on a project.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Users should be able to see a list of issues/tasks in an LHS panel, and then open the details in a right side panel - this should be much faster than switching to a new screen. &nbsp;Obviously it can be difficult to get everything on one screen, but wide-screens are common.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>We are potentialy standardising on Office 365, and maybe we could integrate with it more directly - this might make it easier to discuss PTS issues in outlook?</li>
</ol>
<h1>Previous Designs and Implementation</h1>
<hr>
<p>We have this google doc:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KoKEDLR3P6TGMSHyIdsV69MlWnkbu88FylY6haNcyU4/edit#heading=h.m1ppfmqbyw70">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KoKEDLR3P6TGMSHyIdsV69MlWnkbu88FylY6haNcyU4/edit#heading=h.m1ppfmqbyw70</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And the associated XLS:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="https://drive.google.com/a/bbconsult.co.uk/file/d/0BwrpSzy5Mr1HMEJaLU1DNG9WR28/view?ths=true">https://drive.google.com/a/bbconsult.co.uk/file/d/0BwrpSzy5Mr1HMEJaLU1DNG9WR28/view?ths=true</a>&nbsp;<br><br>We have new issues page here -&nbsp;<a href="http://ptsa.bbconsult.co.uk/#/issues">http://ptsa.bbconsult.co.uk/#/issues</a></p>
<h1>Review / Edit Issues without Opening New Window</h1>
<hr>
<p>I think the best idea is to have a dual mode screen. &nbsp;I open up the issues/tasks/tickets search screen, and I&nbsp; can perform filtered searches and see a big grid. &nbsp;I can use a tooltip to view more details. &nbsp; If I click the issue<br>title, the grid shrinks to only a few columns, and an editor panel appears on the right. &nbsp;I can now click on issues and they appear in the right hand side panel.</p>
<p>Another option: &nbsp;we display the detail window in a separate screen. &nbsp;Some BB people spend a lot of time reviewing issues, and they could have one smaller screen to show the issue list, another larger screen<br>to show the detail. &nbsp; To support this we'd need to have a special mode which can be enabled and saved to that PCs' cookies.&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Review Issues / Tasks / Tickets in One Screen</h1>
<hr>
<p>I think it's useful to have a single screen where I can see all issues and tasks for a project, and&nbsp; review / close them. &nbsp;The "issue editor" panel would change depending on which item is selected.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what issues this presents? &nbsp; I guess for issues / tasks do not have identical status values which may make filtering more complex?</p>
<h1>Implementation Approach</h1>
<hr>
<p>I suggest</p>
<ul>
  <li>We review and improve the new Angular issues screen, taking time to get it right - and thinking of it as a template for other screens to come<br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>We implement the dual mode with a dummy issue review panel, and see how this feels<br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>We then work on the full issue panel, so we can put this into general use<br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>The we do tasks screen and tasks panel<br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Then we create a merged tasks / issues screen</li>
</ul>

<h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
<p>We've tried many todo list management tools previously - like todo ist and toodledo</p>
<p>I'd like to use PTS as the todo list for BB people.</p>
<h1><strong>Implementation</strong></h1>
<p>I think we need a mobile-compatble web view which shows all the tasks I'm responsible for.</p>
<p>It will take a bit more design&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Blueberry Group : Amazon Web Services: Deploying a new live version of AWS BVI&nbsp;</h1>
<p>Created by Jason Cozza on Nov 24, 2020</p>
<h2>Checking Lambda:</h2>
<p>Before deploying a new live version, the lambdas need the following checks:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Cognito_BVI_Post_Authentication_Python<ul>
      <li>Check if every SQL query are functional.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Cognito_BVI_Pre_Sign_up_Python<ul>
      <li>Check if every SQL query are functional.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Note: <strong>Grabcut</strong> and <strong>BVI engine</strong> are also using SQL so they need a check as well.</p>
<h2>Test Run:</h2>
<p>Once all lambdas have been checked and change to use the next live values. A full test is required and any critical fail need fixing.</p>
<p>For this it is best to double check that all API Gateway end points are using the correct Lambda on the beta stage.</p>
<h2>Deploying a new live version:</h2>
<p>Once the future version has passed the test program, create a new version of the lambdas and stage using the instruction at the following link: <a href="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/display/BLUEB/Amazon+Web+Services%3A+Deploying+a+stable+stage+of+an+API+gateway+calling+Lambda">https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/display/BLUEB/Amazon+Web+Services%3A+Deploying+a+stable+stage+of+an+API+gateway+calling+Lambda</a></p>
<p>The new stage should be named “app_test_” followed by the release date. Ex: ‘app_test_17_02_17’.</p>
<p>Once the API deployed reverse all method to use the latest lambda to avoid having to do so when deploying the next time to beta.</p>
<p>Then make a copy of the swagger file and rename it to contain the new stage name.</p>
<p>The next step is to update the app_test usage Plan:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Go to Usage Plans</li>
  <li>Select the usage plan you want to add to stage to.</li>
  <li>Under "Associated API Stages" choose the BVI Web Service API for the API and then choose the new created Stage.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Blueberry Group : Amazon Web Services: Python lambda&nbsp;</h1>
<p>Created by Jason Cozza on Nov 24, 2020</p>
<h1>Python lambda:</h1>
<p>To get started with using AWS Lambda this link will get you through the basic tutorial of making a lambda function: <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/getting-started.html">http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/getting-started.html</a></p>
<h2>Boto3:</h2>
<p>Boto3 is the AWS SDK for Python. Its documentation can be found here: <a href="https://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">https://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/</a></p>
<p>To use Boto3 on AWS lambda you just need to import the module in the code as amazon already has it installed. You will also need to give your lambda a role which allow access to the resources your function will be using.</p>
<p>To use Boto3 on a computer you will need to install boto3 on your python environment and save a IAM key in a config file in your user folder as explained here:</p>
<p><a href="https://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/quickstart.html#configuration">https://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/quickstart.html#configuration</a></p>
<p>For example, the location where you will save the key in windows would be: C:\Users\User-Name\.aws</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To learn how to access AWS resources Boto3 has a good documentation here: <a href="https://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/services/index.html">https://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/services/index.html</a></p>
<p>There are two way to access to Aws resources:</p>
<ul>
  <li>By using the client: client = boto3.client('sqs')</li>
  <li>By using the resource: sqs = boto3.resource('sqs')</li>
</ul>
<p>The main difference is if you need to create new resources like a new SQS queues you will need to use the client and if you just need to access existing resources using ‘resource’ is better although you can also do it using the client.</p>
<h2>Import Package AWS don’t have by default:</h2>
<p>To import package that AWS doesn’t have you will need to create a zip file with the package in it and your python code. Then upload your code to AWS using the upload from a zip file option and in the configuration of your lambda change the Handler to: ‘file_name.method’ where file name is the name of your python file and method is the name of your event handler method.</p>
<p>To know what exactly needs to be added to the zip file read here: <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-python-how-to-create-deployment-package.html">http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-python-how-to-create-deployment-package.html</a></p>
<p><strong>Also, please note that AWS run with Linux so some package installed on windows might be missing stuff to run on Linux environment like it’s the case with ‘pymssql’ so it’s best to add package installed from a Linux environment.</strong></p>

<h1>Blueberry Group : Cognito&nbsp;</h1>
<p>Created by Jason Cozza on Nov 24, 2020</p>
<h1>How it’s set up:</h1>
<h2>Attributes</h2>
<p>Once a Cognito user poll has been created you cannot change the required attributes from the list of proposed attributes. Nor can you delete a custom attribute once created.</p>
<p>To make a custom attribute required you will need to create a lambda that gets triggered at post register (see Triggers below).</p>
<p>The only attributes used are Email and custom:API_Key all other attributes are legacies from an old plan/setup.</p>
<h3>Standard Attributes:</h3>
<p>Email -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Required - Alias</p>

<h3>Custom Attributes:</h3>
<p>custom:API_Key -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Required</p>
<p>custom:height -</p>
<p>custom:weight -</p>
<p>custom:birthyear -</p>
<p>custom:ethnicity -</p>
<p>custom:activity -</p>
<p>custom:country -</p>
<p>custom:market_contact -</p>
<p>custom:notification_freq –</p>
<h2>Policies</h2>
<p>Password minimum Length is 8, requires: Numbers, Uppercase letters and Lowercase letters.</p>
<p>Users are allowed to sign themselves up (via email validation).</p>
<p>After 7 days if a created account hasn’t been used, it should expire.</p>
<h2>Verifications</h2>
<p>Verification is made by email and MFA is disabled.</p>
<h2>Message customizations</h2>
<p>Message customization is handled by using the custom message trigger. The email used is <a href="mailto:bvi-support@bbconsult.co.uk">bvi-support@bbconsult.co.uk</a></p>
<h2>Devices</h2>
<p>Device remembering is set to NO because we couldn’t make the .Net SDK log back in with the remembered device. See: Cognito for .Net</p>
<h2>Apps</h2>
<p>The currently used app is mybvi2 which has app client secret enabled as well as admin_no_srp_auth and its refresh token expires in 30 days.</p>
<h2>Triggers</h2>
<p>Documentation about Cognito triggers can be found <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools-working-with-aws-lambda-triggers.html?icmpid=docs_cognito_console">Here.</a></p>
<p>Our Cognito uses three triggers:</p>
<p><strong>CustomMessage:</strong></p>
<p>Used for customising the email, sent on a new register, or on forgot password.</p>
<p>Example: <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools-working-with-aws-lambda-triggers.html?icmpid=docs_cognito_console#cognito-user-pools-lambda-trigger-syntax-custom-message-example">aws-lambda-triggers-custom-message-example</a></p>

<h1>Blueberry Group : Cognito for .Net:&nbsp;</h1>
<p>Created by Jason Cozza on Nov 24, 2020</p>
<p>Using Cognito in .Net is a bit tricky as it doesn’t have all the call tidied up like the other SDKs do to Authenticate, register, validate…</p>
<p>Instead you need to handle all of the crypto and making the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Remote_Password_protocol">SRP</a> protocol work. Thankfully a feature request has been opened and some people shared their solution here: <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-net/issues/495">https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-net/issues/495</a></p>
<p>Those solutions are mostly based on the JS SDK: <a href="https://github.com/aws/amazon-cognito-identity-js/tree/master/src">https://github.com/aws/amazon-cognito-identity-js/tree/master/src</a></p>
<p>In the end this is what has been used in the BVI Test app: <a href="https://gist.github.com/BBNicolas/5ab3f1f8c604ebe2e4ecf14c35487495">https://gist.github.com/BBNicolas/5ab3f1f8c604ebe2e4ecf14c35487495</a></p>
<p>What has been done:</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Register</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Validation</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Login</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Forgot password</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Refresh</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Logout</p>
<p>Part of the device remembering is working (signing in with a new device and remembering it). But when login in a second time using the device key it fails at the Device Authentication.</p>

<p>Using a token with AWS API Gateway is really easy, you can find a step by step instruction in AWS documentation here: <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-integrate-with-cognito.html">http://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-integrate-with-cognito.html</a></p>
<p>Create a new API or select an existing API in API Gateway.</p>
<p>From the main navigation pane, choose <strong>Authorizers</strong> under the specified API.</p>
<p>Under <strong>Authorizers</strong>, choose <strong>Create</strong> and then choose <strong>Cognito User Pool Authorizer</strong>.</p>
<p>To configure this authorizer:</p>
<p>Choose a region for <strong>Cognito region</strong>.</p>
<p>For <strong>Cognito User Pool</strong>, choose an available user pool.</p>
<p>The <strong>Authorizer name</strong> field will be automatically populated with the chosen user pool name. However, you can customize it if you want to.</p>
<p>The <strong>Identity token source</strong> field will be set to <code>method.request.header.Authorization</code> by default. However, you can customize it if you want to. Using the default, <code>Authorization</code> will be the name of the incoming request header to contain an API caller's identity token.</p>
<p>Optionally, type a regular expression in the <strong>App client ID regex</strong> field to validate client IDs associated with the user pool.</p>
<p>Choose <strong>Create</strong> to finish integrating the user pool with the API.</p>
<p>Having created the authorizer, you can, optionally, test it by supplying an identity token provisioned from the user pool.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Doing the verification yourself is a bit more work but a aws blog show how to do it:</p>

<p>You just need to fill in the user poll id and session token and you can run it with nodejs.</p>

<h1>Basic Description</h1>
<p>Customer has an app that will take two pictures, one from the front, one from the side, create an outline around their profiles, and then send the outlines to the server along with the metrics (height/weight/ethnicity/gender), via a <strong>scan/startsgb</strong> post call.</p>
<p>They get a scan ID returned, and then will send in a JSON packet which contains the results of the survey taken before the images were taken.</p>
<p>The Survey will be linked to the scan via this scan ID.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Examining the data</h1>
<p>The credentials are in Bitwarden, under BVI ShapeGB SQL Express Server. Use SSMS to log in.</p>
<p>The most important tables are <strong>Job</strong>, <strong>SgbSurveyReponses</strong>, and the view <strong>JobMeasurements</strong>.</p>
<h2>dbo.Job</h2>
<p>The following are important columns</p>
<h3>Status</h3>
<ul>
  <li>This shows the status of the scan. If it is a 6, it means that all stages are fine, as there are six stages, and once each stage is passed successfully, it will increment this status.</li>
  <li>-1 means we have detected an issue, normally outside of the system.</li>
  <li>any number lower than 6, means it has failed on the next stage (so a 5 means that there was an error in stage 6, when processing the scan)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Error Text</h3>
<p>If the scan failed (specifically if it was -1), the contents of this should give insight into what has gone wrong.</p>
<h3>Height/Weight/Age/Gender/Ethnicity</h3>
<p>These are all survey information entered by the app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>SgbSurveryResponses</h2>
<p>This table stores the survey responses, taken through the app, in a JSON format. Each survey is linked to to a Job.ID</p>
<p>Example Response:</p>
<figure class="table">
  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <th>{"size_male_trouser":"28L","bonus_enter_prize_draw":false,"about_postcode":"W2","size_male_jacket":"34R","size_male_collar":"15.5 (M)","brands_where_shop":["John Lewis"],"brands_heard_about":"New Look","version":1,"about_ethnicity":"Asian"}</th>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>JobMeasurements</h2>
<p>This is a view created from two tables:</p>
<p>OrdMeasurementsKind which contains the index and measurement area. There are different apps that handle scans, so there isa&nbsp; set of indexes for various measurements per app. For example, the latest app uses ID 297-312 as it's indexes for measurements.</p>
<p>OrdMeasurements which fills in the values attributed to the indexes found in OrdMeasurementsKind, and links it back to the Job.&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Accessing the silhouettes</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Use the S3Browser, and navigate to bvi-api-uk/SGB/</li>
  <li>In there are the job folders (which correspond to the ID in the Job table), and inside each one are the two silhouettes.</li>
  <li>Highlight the silhouettes, click Download and point them to a file</li>
  <li>They will download (there is no indicator that they have downloaded!)</li>
  <li>Opening these in Notepad++ show a list of co-ordinates, used by the image software to show the outline.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Blueberry Group : Swagger UI documentation&nbsp;</h1>
<p>Created by Jason Cozza on Nov 24, 2020</p>
<p>BVI's Swagger UI documentation is hosted at&nbsp;<a href="https://bvi-swagger.bbconsult.co.uk">https://bvi-swagger.bbconsult.co.uk</a>. Credentials are available in LastPass.</p>
<p>The documentation is generated at runtime through the use of <a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui">swagger-ui</a>. A Jenkins job checks out the latest version of this, alters the public/index.html to reference the BVI YAML, and then publishes it to&nbsp;<strong>/opt/bvi-swagger/</strong>.</p>
<p>To make modifications to the documentation, check out and modify the YAML from the bvi SVN project in the directory&nbsp;<strong>BviAws/Swagger</strong>.</p>
<p>Use the path bar at the top of the page to access different swagger YAML files if required.</p>

<h1>Blueberry Group : FlashBack Marketing Tasks&nbsp;</h1>
<p>Created by Jason Cozza on Nov 24, 2020</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Immediate priorities:</strong></h3>
<p><br><strong>Business - Personal pricing</strong></p>
<p>The prices are decided, the pages are ready. We're waiting on changes from Oliver, a minor ones from Alex. Then we can make it live. Hopefully before the 14th. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Skype inbound campaign</strong></p>
<p>We were seeing very low conversion (to download) rates from the "Record&nbsp;Skype" ads, on Facebook and Adwords. I've stopped the Facebook ads for now and put their budget into Adwords, which were converting better.&nbsp;We've changed the landing page and made the ad keywords more targeted and this&nbsp;&nbsp;has improved the rate, but not by a huge amount. We're surprised by this - the ads are targetted and the page relevant.&nbsp;Matt is making one more revision of the page, and I'll work on the keywords again when we have more data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Next inbound campaign</strong></p>
<p>Matt has suggested "Flipped classroom". We can reuse text already written by Anna for&nbsp;the landing page, which Matt will start on very soon. Facebook ads may get better returns this time - we should be able to target educators &nbsp;using their system, which is not possible using adwords.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Application improvements</strong></p>
<p>-&nbsp;FB UI</p>
<p>The&nbsp;main change we're working on is to give a consistent 'home' screen for FB. When FB starts, we show a 'Welcome' screen with links to tutorials, recent movies and to 'Record the screen'. But the user never returns to this. Other screen recorders have a similar screen that the user is returned to after closing the Recorder. Were still&nbsp;working on a new design that displays Help, Recordings and feels like a genuine improvement over the current one. Other changes to the region and window recording UI, 'inspired' by other recorders, are already designed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Tutorials</p>
<p>As part of the UI changes, we plan to make a few&nbsp;single page tutorials on basic tasks. A page, in Hubspot will be far easier to maintain than a movie.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Improved upsell from Express</p>
<p>This is a&nbsp;top priority for October.&nbsp;Currently we make no effort to upsell Express users on Plus/Pro, so even if we&nbsp;only succeed with&nbsp;a very small fraction it could&nbsp;represent a significant rise in&nbsp;sales. A first attempt at&nbsp;implementing this was unsuccessful, but the second try is looking good. We should be there before the 22nd.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br><strong>Email campaigns</strong></p>
<p>When the Business-person pricing is in place, we'll change the Pro/Plus email&nbsp;campaigns to send a discount on day 3. Mark has suggested Pro Business -&gt; $69 and Personal -&gt; $29. Ok.</p>
<p><br>We will also start to email Express users, pushing Pro/Plus (no discount).&nbsp;Currently we don't push Express downloaders into HS, but it should be simple for&nbsp;Oliver to do this. We&nbsp;can filter out &gt;90% of them in HS and there should still be enough to get data on email clicks, and whether visitors from the email buy.</p>
<p><strong>More inbound marketing</strong></p>
<p>Matt is keen to get a blog running (in Hubspot), using an agency to write articles based on briefs from ourselves. The content can be reused and linked from social media.&nbsp;We have 4 themes we'd like to start with and Matt is getting prices.</p>
<p><strong>Remarketing ads</strong></p>
<p>We've stalled on this a bit. We had images, but they needed improving. I'd looked into running a remarketing campaign in adwords.&nbsp;Once we have a set of images,&nbsp;then we should be able to get some ads going soon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>FBX</strong></p>
<p>John seems to have cracked the crash problem. Victor is working on one more set of improvements, and then its out to BB staff. I've been working on UI, don't have anything I'm entirely happy with yet, but we need to move on, so it may be a 'v1' for the beta.&nbsp;Matt has got a download/landing&nbsp;page designed. I have a design doc outlining things like account creation, UI,&nbsp;how we implement beta and trials, what websites we need,&nbsp;that John has been reading and commenting on. There's a lot for him to do and&nbsp;I hope he can get good focus on this for the rest of the year.</p>
<h3>For Later:</h3>
<p><strong>Affiliates</strong></p>
<p>I know some people are cold on affiliates, but we're keen to see if we can test the water because its another option&nbsp;we've never&nbsp;tried.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We're faced with the choice of either going with an existing affiliate network or making our own. Using an existing network should get us more affiliates, quickly, but will take a %. We've already done most of the work for tracking sales for resellers, so much of the work in creating our own network is in the sales reporting, settlements. This could be a fair sized task though. The approach we've suggested before is to try a network, to see if we get anything. If we do, we can consider making our network. If not, leave it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We've also wondered about an 'affiliate-lite' kind of approach, targetting Youtube users. We have a "Make money from your Youtube videos" campaign, with banners on the site, emails, social media. They sign up, get a unique URL to post in the description of their video. When someone downloads and purchases off that URL, they get a payment. We give them a basic page to track downloads, sales. By not saying "this is an affiliate system", we're wondering if we can reduce the requirements, but settlements to the affiliates may be difficult.</p>
<p><br>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Store</strong></p>
<p>Less urgent since we've improved the exit rate from the final step of the purchase process, but would still like to try a single page purchase process for FB, using the new iframe-less Braintree API.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TA</strong></p>
<p>Reduce to one edition. Reduce price in line with FB. Bring it into the main site.</p>
<p><br>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>FB Trial period</strong></p>
<p>Trials are generally 30 days, but Movavi go for a shorter 7 days. Pros for a shorter period: you can send that 'last chance discount' mail sooner, and you may reduce the number of people that get what they want from FB just via the trial (we've increased the watermark size recently though). Cons: some users don't get the chance to use FB within 7 days and will need to ask for extension of their trial licence.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Licence-less&nbsp;</strong><br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We use a system that sends a licence to the user to confirm their email address. After one day of trial (or immediately, with Express) the user needs to enter the licence key we emailed them the day before, to use FB again. None of our competitors that I'm aware of use a system like this. Camtasia collects an email address for marketing, but they don't send a licence to it. About 2/3 of Pro licences and 3/4 of Plus licences we send out are never entered into FB, so that's 2/3 and 3/4 of installations that cannot be used beyond the first day. This looks like something we can improve on. At the very least, we could give users a longer 'licence-less' period. What we're trying to improve here is engagement with FB, so the stats we can watch are those on the number of times recorder and player are run, and movies recorded.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Localisation</strong></p>
<p>To prove or disprove the "sell cheap in populous low-income countries" theory, we</p>
<p>&nbsp; - Translate the website or main pages into Russian. How that's best implemented is to be figured out. I'm hoping we can do something using simple subfolders in HS, so we don't need to purchase a translation management system.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; - Mark wants to set prices for FB-Russian lower? Ok.</p>
<p>&nbsp; - We could add a lower priority task for Oliver to look at adding <a href="https://money">https://money</a>.ru or <a href="https://www.webmoney.ru/">https://www.webmoney.ru</a></p>

<h1>Blueberry Group : About WIX&nbsp;</h1>
<p>Created by Jason Cozza on Nov 24, 2020</p>
<p>Wix is a tool set that allows you to create windows installers using XML format.</p>
<p>It has mainly two set of tools:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The standard, which allows the creation of a normal installer.</li>
  <li>And Burn or also named Wix Bootstrapper which allows bundling multiple installers together and chain install them.</li>
</ol>
<p>The standard has some descent tutorials and instruction to follow which can be found in the external resources of the Wix Documentation page: <a href="http://wixtoolset.org/documentation/">http://wixtoolset.org/documentation/</a></p>
<p>The bootstrapper can be a bit more tricky as not a lot of tutorial have been made and most of the instruction are going to be pointing to Wix actual installer's source code.</p>
<h1>Wix Bootstrapper (Wix Burn)</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first thing to know about Wix's Bootstrapper is that it's separated in three parts:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The bundle</li>
  <li>The Bootstrapper / UI in c#</li>
  <li>The Bootstrapper engine</li>
</ol>
<p>The bundle is where you will declare all your msi, the conditions regarding the machine and the <strong>bootstrapper to use</strong>.</p>
<p>Wix does provides some basic bootstrappers that can be used but they are really light and aren't much flexible.</p>
<p>If some more complex behavior are needed instead of what the basic bootstrappers Wix provides you will need to make a custom Bootstrapper.</p>
<p>All you need to do to create a&nbsp;bootstrapper is to have a class inherit from the abstract class "BootstrapperApplication" and you got your bootstrapper which also contains its engine. The BootstrapperApplication class is located in "Microsoft.Tools.WindowsInstallerXml.Bootstrapper" in the&nbsp;Microsoft.Deployment.WindowsInstaller.dll which is provided by Wix's SDK.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your bootstrapper will have a range of event handler which can be categorized in three installation phases: Detection, Planning and Applying.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Detection phase is where the bootstrapper will look for the status of the future msi to install, if there are absent, present or need an update. This is where you will be able to populate your installer's UI with the correct values.</li>
  <li>The Panning phase is where the bootstrapper will cash the msi and make a plan of what needs to be installed, uninstalled or repaired. This is where you will be able to choose if the installer will have to skip a certain msi based on some logic in your UI.</li>
  <li>The Applying phase is where the bootstrapper does his magic and go thought the planning to execute the msi.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of those need to be started by the engine by calling it's designated method ex: Bootstrapper.Engine.Detect().</p>
<p>The whole process of the bootstrapper really rely on calling those methods and handling the events which aren't well documented.</p>
<p>Some documentation can be found in the source code under src\burn\inc\IBootstrapperApplication.h which can be useful to know what return value you can use but most of the time you would just want to log the information that get passed though and work from there.</p>
<p>Finally here is a useful link to the most complete tutorial I found: <a href="http://www.wrightfully.com/part-1-of-writing-your-own-net-based-installer-with-wix-overview">http://www.wrightfully.com/part-1-of-writing-your-own-net-based-installer-with-wix-overview</a></p>

<h1>Blueberry Group : Parcel SafePlace (PackageRoom) iPad application&nbsp;</h1>
<p>Created by Jason Cozza on Nov 24, 2020</p>
<p>This document aims to describe the build and release process for the Parcel SafePlace iPad application.</p>
<h1>Source code</h1>
<p>The source code for the application resides in the <a href="https://svn.bbconsult.co.uk/repository/packageroom/trunk/iPad%20application/">packageroom</a> repository. Use SVN to checkout the code to somewhere on your Mac that Xcode can see.</p>
<p>A VM has already been set up within the Birmingham office with the necessary tools and configuration to release the application. See the BitWarden note 'macOS VM: Parcel Safeplace'.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Build environment</h1>
<p>The iPad application requires the following to build:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Xcode</li>
  <li>Developer certificates, either personal or from the <strong>Parcel Safe Place Limited</strong> account</li>
</ul>
<p>The iPad application requires the following to release:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Xcode Organiser / Application Loader</li>
  <li>Being part of the Parcel Safe Place Limited enterprise team (ask Ben Waters at Parcel Safeplace for help with this)</li>
  <li>Possessing the Parcel Safeplace distribution certificate</li>
</ul>
<h2>Preparing the environment</h2>
<p>Open&nbsp;<strong>Xcode&nbsp;→ Preferences</strong> and add the account you used to join the Parcel Safeplace Limited enterprise team. In our case, this is <strong>apple@bbconsult.co.uk</strong>, the details of which are in the 'BB Consult Dev Account' BW note.&nbsp;Once signed in, click <strong>View Details...</strong> when highlighting the&nbsp;<strong>Parcel Safe Place Limited</strong> team&nbsp;and ensure that iOS development and iOS distribution certificates are on your machine. If they aren't, use the&nbsp;<strong>Create</strong>&nbsp;button to request them. Download any provisioning profiles using the&nbsp;<strong>Download all&nbsp;</strong>button.</p>
<p>If the distribution certificate needs renewing or resetting, follow the instructions at <a href="https://developer.apple.com">developer.apple.com</a> in the&nbsp;<strong>Certificates, Identifiers &amp; Profiles</strong>&nbsp;page, otherwise skip to the next section. Click&nbsp;<strong>Certificates&nbsp;→ Production&nbsp;</strong>and follow the instructions. You'll need to generate a certificate signing request using the&nbsp;<strong>Keychain Access</strong> app on your Mac. Click&nbsp;<strong>Keychain Access&nbsp;→ Certificate Assistant&nbsp;→ Request a Certificate from a Certificate Authority.</strong> Use&nbsp;<strong>admin@parcelsafeplace.com&nbsp;</strong>in the email field,&nbsp;<strong>Parcel SafePlace&nbsp;</strong>in the common name field, and leave the CA email field blank.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493753/85493754.png"></figure>
<p>Click the option to save the file to disk. Now upload the CSR when requested by the certificate request wizard on the Apple developer portal, and it should return a new certificate which you can then import back into&nbsp;<strong>Keychain Access</strong> using&nbsp;<strong>File&nbsp;→ Import</strong>. You should now see the new certificate in the&nbsp;<strong>login</strong> keychain. The old distribution certificate/key can safely be removed. The instructions are the same for normal developer certificates, just choose&nbsp;<strong>Certificates&nbsp;→ Development&nbsp;</strong>in the developer portal.</p>
<p>As you've created a new distribution certificate, you need to also create a new distribution provisioning profile, or edit the existing one to point to the new certificate and then download it in Xcode again. To create a new profile, select&nbsp;<strong>Provisioning Profiles&nbsp;→ Distribution</strong> in the developer portal and click the&nbsp;<strong>+</strong> icon, select App Store distribution, ensure that the correct app ID (com.parcelsafeplace) is selected, then select the new certificate you generated earlier. To edit an existing profile, select it and click&nbsp;<strong>Edit</strong>, then select the new distribution certificate you created earlier. Either option will generate a new profile, which you can then download in the Xcode account details pane.</p>
<h2>Sharing certificates/keys across machines</h2>
<p>While provisioning profiles can be downloaded again to a new machine via Xcode, the private key tied to a certificate is stored in the keychain of the Mac which generated the initial CSR. To migrate or share the certificate, the key must be exported alongside it. Right click the certificate in&nbsp;<strong>Keychain Access</strong> and select the export option. Save it somewhere, and encrypt it with a password when prompted. Use the&nbsp;<strong>File&nbsp;→ Import</strong> option on the destination machine and use the same password to decrypt when importing. Delete exported file when finished.</p>
<h1>Building and running the application</h1>
<p>Open the project in Xcode and ensure that the&nbsp;<strong>Parcel Safe Place Limited</strong>&nbsp;team is selected.</p>
<p>Select the correct scheme using the scheme menu in Xcode.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493753/85493755.png?effects=drop-shadow"></figure>
<p>Click the play icon on the control bar across the top of Xcode to run the app with the active scheme.</p>
<p>Alternatively, use the&nbsp;<strong>Product</strong> menu to build without running, or run the last built version of the app.</p>
<p>Connect an iPad and select it from the scheme menu if you want to test on a physical device. This will require you to trust your Mac on the iPad, and will trigger Xcode to generate provisioning profiles for the device.</p>
<h1>Releasing the application</h1>
<p>Parcel Safeplace used to use Testflight as a distribution mechanism, but have switched to using Miradore as an MDM solution and also use it to distribute applications.</p>
<p>Ensure that you've selected a valid scheme for release. If in doubt, select the&nbsp;<strong>Generic iOS Device</strong> scheme.</p>
<p>Once you're ready to release, increment the build number in the <strong>General</strong> tab, and&nbsp;use the&nbsp;<strong>Product&nbsp;→ Archive</strong> menu to prepare a release.</p>
<p>In the organizer window, select the newly built archive and select&nbsp;<strong>Distribute App</strong>. Choose manual signing, and select 'Ad Hoc' distribution, and select the appropriate distribution certificate when prompted.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can use the&nbsp;<strong>Application Loader </strong>in the&nbsp;<strong>Window</strong> menu of Xcode. This is not covered in this article.</p>
<p>The signed IPA is then sent to our contact at Parcel Safeplace via email. At the time of writing, this is Ben Waters.</p>
<h1>Adding devices to the provisioning profile</h1>
<p>Occasionally, Parcel Safeplace may want to add new devices to the provisioning profile used for distribution. Simply add the devices in the Apple developer portal, regenerate the profile, and then import it into Xcode.</p>

<h1>Blueberry Group : Parcel SafePlace System Architecture&nbsp;</h1>
<p>Created by Jason Cozza on Nov 24, 2020</p>
<p>Parcel SafePlace (hereafter referred to as PSP) is a system for dropping off and retrieving packages at a shared residency.</p>
<p>The system consists of three major components:</p>
<ul>
  <li>iPad application</li>
  <li>Web Portal + Database</li>
  <li>Raspberry Pi</li>
</ul>
<h1>iPad application</h1>
<p>The iPad application allows carriers to make deliveries to a residency, managers to open lockers, and residents to open their locker.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493756/85493761.png?effects=drop-shadow"></figure>
<p>The app allows the carrier to take a picture of the label, which is then associated with the delivery on the web portal. For every package delivered, the carrier can select the locker to store the package in. In Dustin's case, each residency uses a shared 'Package Room', access to which is controlled by a relay connected to the Raspberry Pi. The iPad app sends a HTTP request to a web server running on the Pi, which then fires the relay via GPIO. Once a delivery has been confirmed, the web portal sends out an email and SMS to the resident with their pickup code, which they can then use to retrieve the package at their convenience.</p>
<p>If a manager enters their code they can view the status of, and override the locks, on lockers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Web portal</h1>
<p>The web portal has multiple interfaces depending on the role of the logged in user.</p>
<h2>Administrator interface</h2>
<p>The admin interface provides a global view into the system, allowing the admin to view or modify any aspect of the system.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493756/85493759.png"></figure>
<h2>Manager interface</h2>
<p>The manager interface provides a location-specific view for deliveries and residents. The location can be changed using a drop-down menu at the top-right of the page.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493756/85493758.png"></figure>
<h2>Resident interface</h2>
<p>The resident interface provides a way for residents to view delivered parcels and update their personal information.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493756/85493757.png"></figure>
<h1>Raspberry Pi</h1>
<p>The Pi serves the role of the hardware bridge to the lockers, allowing the iPad application or web portal to open physical lockers on site. In order to open the lockers, the Pi is equipped with a shield which is then wired to the locker(s).</p>
<p>The iPad app communicates with the Pi through a small web server on the Pi which exposes an API, allowing lockers to be opened.</p>
<p>The Pi also acts as the internet gateway for the iPad, allowing it to sync data with the web portal server.</p>
<p>Additionally, an OpenVPN client is installed which connects back to the web portal server, allowing remote diagnostics if required.</p>

<h1>Blueberry Group : Zebra Printer&nbsp;</h1>
<p>Created by Jason Cozza on Nov 24, 2020</p>
<p><i>For the RAGS Zebra label printer in Systems (Stonehouse) see </i><a href="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=79135286"><i>Systems Support - Printers</i></a><br>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>This is out of date</i></p>
<p>The Keltbary Ticketing functionality uses a Zebra Printer Bluetooth connected to the tablet</p>
<p>There is a simulator here: <a href="http://labelary.com/viewer.html">http://labelary.com/viewer.html</a>&nbsp; It’s not perfect and the font sizing can be a bit inaccurate, but it’s a good guide. Note that we are using 3-inch continuous paper so set the dimensions to be 3 x (large enough number to contain all the printed data)</p>
<p>The current code is in BBWT.Web\app\directives\formApp\printForm.ts.</p>
<p>The conveyanceModeLayout() function generates a print template for the Conveyancing form. The code here is very rough and was written as just a proof-of-concept, and I’d recommend refactoring it into a base PrintTemplateWriter class (and ConveryanceNoteTemplateWriter sub-class) before doing anything else with it, because at the moment it’s specific to the conveyance note and doesn’t expose any functionality that could be shared with other forms. The base class would provide some functionality for generic formatting (like the bold() function does), and keep track of the x and y coordinates – although the structure of the ZPL language makes it hard to map to a nice OO API.</p>
<h1>ZPL</h1>
<p>The template is in a language called ZPL, which you can find a manual on here:&nbsp; <a href="https://www.zebra.com/content/dam/zebra/manuals/en-us/software/zpl-zbi2-pm-en.pdf">https://www.zebra.com/content/dam/zebra/manuals/en-us/software/zpl-zbi2-pm-en.pdf</a>&nbsp; it’s not a nice language and it doesn’t provide you with the things you expect – for example, to do bold text you need to print the same text three times in slightly different positions. &nbsp;Something else to be aware of is that you have to set the vertical length of the printed data at the top of the form (with ^LL), but you probably won’t know this until you’ve finished generating the template.</p>
<h1>Pairing With Printer</h1>
<p>&nbsp;Also: I’ve started moving the scan() functionality into BBWT.Web\app\services\formApp\PrintService.ts (not yet committed, but will be soon). If you find that you want to add more functionality into the print directive, it might make sense to put it into the PrintService instead.</p>

<p>Instructions for adding tables to synchronization process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>Your entity should be inherited from SyncEntity if instances will be created offline, otherwise from Entity. PK types other than int and Guid are not supported in Eforms (could be if needed, but it needs code changes)</li>
  <li>Create new migration and add your table to the synchronization scope like this:</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;string scopeName = "designData";</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;var provisionHelper = new SyncProvisionHelper();</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;using (var serverConn = new SqlConnection(ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings["DefaultConnection"].ConnectionString))</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; var scopeDesc = new DbSyncScopeDescription(scopeName);</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;scopeDesc.Tables.Add(SqlSyncDescriptionBuilder.GetDescriptionForTable("BusinessArea", serverConn));</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; scopeDesc.Tables.Add(SqlSyncDescriptionBuilder.GetDescriptionForTable("BusinessAreaGroup", serverConn));</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; scopeDesc.Tables.Add(SqlSyncDescriptionBuilder.GetDescriptionForTable("FormStatus", serverConn));</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; scopeDesc.Tables.Add(SqlSyncDescriptionBuilder.GetDescriptionForTable("Ticket", serverConn));</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; scopeDesc.Tables.Add(SqlSyncDescriptionBuilder.GetDescriptionForTable("SiteUser", serverConn));</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;provisionHelper.UpdateProvision(scopeDesc, new List&lt;string&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "BusinessArea",</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "BusinessAreaGroup",</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "FormStatus",</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ticket"</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; });</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note for not read-only tables:</strong> Principal table should always be added before dependent table, not after. Check this for all principal tables otherwise upload of principal and dependent entity together will fail.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;UpdateProvision() method replaces stored procedures for already added tables, so you do not need to add your tables there the first time, but need to add them in the next migrations which change synchronization.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Run this migration</li>
  <li>Open ClassesGenScript.sql in BBWT.Sync, add there your table:</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;insert into @tmp (name, [readOnly]) values ('Ticket', 0);</p>
<p>&nbsp;Note: Second parameter should be 1 if the data in your table won’t be changed offline.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>Copy this script to SQL Server Management Studio and run against your database. Then copy the result in &lt;root&gt; tag and replace the content of OfflineModels.cs (in BBWT.Sync)</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: If your entity has PK with more than one field then you need to create a separate file with model and not include your table into the script.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>In DesignDataScope.cs add your new model collection. Name doesn’t matter.</li>
  <li>If you table needs filtering when synchronizing (like downloading only entities linked to the current user) add this logic to DataFilter.cs</li>
  <li>In app.ts (BBWT.Web) add new offline table:</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;angular.extend($idbProvider.defaults, {</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; version: 1,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; name: 'Eforms',</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; onUpgradeNeeded: function (session) {</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; session.createObjectStore('BusinessAreas', { keyPath: 'Id' });</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; session.createObjectStore('BusinessAreaGroups', { keyPath: 'Id' });</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; session.createObjectStore('PdfForms', { keyPath: 'Id' });</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; session.createObjectStore('TaskDefinitions', { keyPath: 'Id' });&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indexes if needed are also created here.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>In SyncSvc.cs add link between server and client tables:</li>
</ol>
<p>var tablesToSync: HashTable&lt;ITable&gt; = {&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'BBWT.Sync.OfflineModels.BusinessArea': { localName: 'BusinessAreas', readOnly: true },</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'BBWT.Sync.OfflineModels.BusinessAreaGroup': { localName: 'BusinessAreaGroups', readOnly: true },</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'BBWT.Sync.OfflineModels.PdfForm': { localName: 'PdfForms', readOnly: true },</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'BBWT.Sync.OfflineModels.PdfFormImage': { localName: 'PdfFormImages', readOnly: true },</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again if the entity has more than 1 PK you need to change getEntityId() method here.</p>

<h1>Blueberry Group : AWS Elastic Beanstalk deployment issue&nbsp;</h1>
<p>Created by Jason Cozza on Nov 24, 2020</p>
<p>EB will create a new EC2 instance if the health of the current EC2 is bad.</p>
<p>Currently if this happens the newly created EC2 will spin up without the https (port 443) bindings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you see the Cloudflare 522 error page then you will need to manually add the bindings to the web site in IIS</p>
<p>To do this:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Log into AWS using the PIMeo Blueberry account</li>
  <li>Find the IP address of the newly created server</li>
  <li>Retrieve the password for the server - PEM file is stored in BW</li>
  <li>RDP into the server</li>
  <li>Open IIS</li>
  <li>highlight the Default Web Site (PIMeo)</li>
  <li>Select Bindings under Edit Site on the right<br><br><br>&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493773/85493775.png"></figure>
<ol>
  <li>Add a https binding and select the self signed certificate - as seen below</li>
</ol>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493773/85493774.png"></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This should bring back pimeo.net</p>

<p>**As of 05-10-2018**</p>
<p>Jon Allan is working with Asghar on creating a post deploy script to handle this in AWS EB.</p>

<h1>Blueberry Group : Later Work&nbsp;</h1>
<p>Created by Jason Cozza on Nov 24, 2020</p>

  <li><a href="#LaterWork-MobileMode">Mobile Mode</a></li>
  <li><a href="#LaterWork-Tablesaroundthesite">Tables around the site</a></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Comment Flow</h1>
<p>All forms - Comments - As stated previously the flow of comments is not correct, this is further impacted by the fact there is no View of the Approved order before delivery is confirmed - we need to discuss this</p>
<p>Each area should have a comment:</p>
<ul>
  <li>when ordering the plant item, the orderer can leave a comment regarding when they need it, or further requirements.</li>
  <li>When approving or rejecting the plant item, the back office can leave a comment regarding their reason, or notes to the people on the field</li>
  <li>When confirming delivery, the receiver can leave a comment regarding condition of unit.</li>
</ul>
<p>At each step, you should be able to see the comment previously, and not overwrite it, like it happens today, so on Confirming Delivery, you should be able to see any comments left from the ordering and back office stages.</p>
<h1>Mobile Mode</h1>
<ul>
  <li>The online button shows even if you are offline or online.</li>
  <li>You cannot switch back to online automatically, you have to click the "online" button</li>
  <li>Logout is shown only on Mobile mode, not in regular mode</li>
  <li>Images on project home page do not show</li>
  <li>If you load up Test Form One, the date is missing. If you scroll (by dragging the screen) the date appears.<ul>
      <li>Clicking outside of the form box, does nothing,</li>
      <li>Clicking inside the form box does nothing</li>
      <li>Clicking in one of the disabled drop downs makes the date appear</li>
      <li>zooming in makes the date appear</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Clicking Online while still offline will take the user to the online portion of the site, which if cached, will appear to work, but no data will be shown on anything outside of QA.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Tables around the site</h1>
<p>On bottom of each table, there is a statement of&nbsp; "Records: x of y". When you go to page 2 or 3, the number x does not increase.</p>

<h1>Document Management System (DMS)</h1>
<p>PIMeo uses the Document Management System component and API controller to create the S3 browsing modal for Plant/Material document browsing.&nbsp; It is unsuitable to use this for adding/displaying things like docket images as the file path and URL are replaced with an empty string.</p>
<p>However, there is a service behind this that can be used to for CRUD operations to S3, then the WebAPI imlementation needs to be copied from somewhere where this is already implemented (SiteWork&nbsp;→ RFI for example).</p>
<h1>Steps to update the users password or create a new password:</h1>
<p>1)&nbsp;<a href="https://asecuritysite.com/encryption/PBKDF2z">https://asecuritysite.com/encryption/PBKDF2z</a></p>
<p>2) Enter a password</p>
<p>3) Enter a 64bit salt i.e. FF02F7ED8C1812C05B021F67E2043D19 (stored in database as 0xFF02F7ED8C1812C05B021F67E2043D19)</p>
<p>4) Set Iterations to 10,000</p>
<p>5) Set Key Length to 32bit</p>
<p>6) The Hash (Base-64) value generated will need to be stored as the password for that user in the PIMeo.users.users table</p>
<p><br>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Links to external 'screenshot' files</h1>
<p>These are files that Sean has started creating, that are more recent than the wireframes. There is also a chance he might change them too.</p>

<h1>Off Call and 'Non Off Call'</h1>
<p><br>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Non Off Call<br>&nbsp;</h2>
<p>With Non Off Call orders, There are two options that dictate if the order is placed automatically or goes to back office for approval. These are S<strong>et Daily Spend Limit</strong>, and <strong>Daily Spend Limit is</strong><br>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493780/85493781.png"></figure>
<p><br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The daily spend limit is a cost value (determined by rate x quantity) that if the order is under, will be approved automatically.</p>
<p>The Daily Spend Limit is one of two options, setting it as per order or per day.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Per Order - The daily spend limit is the max for each order, if over, it has to go to back office for approval</li>
  <li>Per Day - The daily spend limit is the max for each day, so each day's order is accumulative</li>
</ul>

<h1>Blueberry Group : Priority List&nbsp;</h1>
<p>Created by Jason Cozza on Nov 24, 2020</p>
<p>The following is a priority list created by the customer, for us to work on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>QA/Photos offline and other issues</li>
  <li>Plant on both the Plant Dept side and the Project side</li>
  <li>Materials on both the Materials Dept side and the Project side</li>
  <li>Allocation Sheets/Timesheets (the upgrade WF is linked in the sheet along side the Allocation Sheet issues</li>
  <li>All the issues with RFI, CVI, Dayworks, Site Diary, Submittals (a bit of work with Submittals, it is not built as per the WF)</li>
  <li>Quantity Surveying - resolve the issues, try to include the Global Costs table, too</li>
  <li>Estimating - resolve the issues</li>
  <li>Everything that remains.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Blueberry Group : Setting up the Development Environment&nbsp;</h1>
<p>Created by Jason Cozza on Nov 24, 2020</p>
<h2>Initial Steps</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Install NodeJS and make sure it is added to your PATH variable (restart if necessary)</li>
  <li>Sync the source code</li>
  <li>Cd to the root of the project repository</li>
  <li>run command "dotnet restore" to restore nuget packages</li>
  <li>Cd into PIMeo.Web</li>
  <li>Use npm to install webpack (currently 4.19.0 - npm install webpack@4.19.0)</li>
  <li>Run "npm i"</li>
  <li>Run "npm run build:dev"</li>
</ul>
<h2>Database Setup</h2>
<ul>
  <li>We have updated the code to use Entity Framework migrations.&nbsp; Migrations will be run when the app runs in a development environment or when it is started with the&nbsp;'--migrate true' tag on the command line<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The default username\password that the system will be created with is: (Will be in BitWarden, if you don't have access ask for it over Wire)</p>
<ul>
  <li><s>There is &nbsp;SeedDemoData.sql&nbsp;script file located in PIMeo.Persistence.SQL which will fill the database with demo data.&nbsp; To use this, your database must be at the InitialCreate version.&nbsp; You can run the following command to achieve this:</s><br><s>'dotnet ef --project ../Persistence/PIMeo.Persistence.SQL -s ./ database update 20180608231453_InitialCreate'</s><br><s>After that, run the SeedDemoData file then run:</s><br><s>'dotnet ef --project ../Persistence/PIMeo.Persistence.SQL -s ./ database update' to update the database to the latest version.</s><br><br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Above is outdated, please contact either Chris Murrary or Jonathon Fitch for a database backup</p>
<ul>
  <li><br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h2>Using Entity Framework</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The commands for using EF are below and to be executed from the PIMeo.Web directory.<br>dotnet ef --project ../Persistence/PIMeo.Persistence.SQL -s ./ migrations add replace_me<br>dotnet ef --project ../Persistence/PIMeo.Persistence.SQL -s ./ database update</li>
</ul>
<h2>Development Notes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Avoid using jQuery - this is an Angular Universal app that can be used with Server-Side Rendering.&nbsp; Currently this is disabled due to some issues, however, if/when we re-enable it, it will make the process faster if we don't have to replace a lot of code that causes problems when run inside a NodeJS environment.<br>You can use Angular ViewChild components to adjust element properties and classes in a SSR-safe way, or if you need to change global properties (CSS colours for example), you can create a custom component for this and add it to the main &lt;app&gt; tag.<br><br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Along the same line as above, any call to document/window or some other JS object that is not available in a NodeJS environment needs to be wrapped in an "if (isPlatformBrowser(PLATFORM_ID))" check.<br><br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Any styles added should be added to the global pimeo.css/pimeo.responsive.css files in wwwroot/css folder - due to the nature of this project we don't know if styles will be needed again so best to create global styles than component-specific styles.<br>If possible, try to create generic styles - yes this means you will need to use more classes in HTML to achieve the desire result, but it makes the needed classes much more reusable and useful.&nbsp; In pimeo.css there is a section headed by the comment /* PIMeo Generic styles */ - see this for examples.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Common Issues:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Chrome forwarding localhost to HTTPS:<br>Go to&nbsp;<a href="chrome://net-internals/#hsts">chrome://net-internals/#hsts</a>&nbsp;and type localhost into the "Delete domain security policies" input field<br><br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Project hangs on the PIMEO MP4 file<br>In the ASP.Net Core logs, wait until you see:<br><br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>PIMeo.Web&gt; webpack built 3f4a7ef1408860e43b46 in 86825ms</p>
<p><br>Then refresh the page.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Application.cs fails to move past<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>app.UseWebpackDevMiddleware(new WebpackDevMiddlewareOptions<br>{<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; HotModuleReplacement = true<br>});</p>
<ul>
  <li><br>This is usually due to Visual Studio failing to find NodeJS in the PATH.&nbsp; A reboot fixed this for me.<br><br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Dotnet restore fails with the target path to SSDT error.<br>Running "dotnet restore /p:RestoreUseSkipNonexistentTargets="false"" fixes this.<br><br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Cookies was not authenticated. Failure message: Unprotect ticket failed<br>This can happen when the ASP.Net Core was listening to a different port than the app was on, switching the port over to the correct one in the PIMeo.Web properties file fixed it.<br><br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Odd issues with ASP.NET failing to find files such as vendor.js, vendor.css<br>I don't know the specific reason for this, however, commenting out the below lines, letting the app run, then uncommenting them again appeared to work - no idea why.&nbsp; If this fails to work then try changing true to false.<br><br>app.UseWebpackDevMiddleware(new WebpackDevMiddlewareOptions<br>{<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; HotModuleReplacement = true<br>});<br><br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Command "npm i" can sometimes fail on windows<br>This is due to windows sometimes not releasing file locks, usually just trying the command again works, but if not the only way to get this working again is to reboot.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Blueberry Group : CDA&nbsp;</h1>
<p>Created by Jason Cozza on Nov 24, 2020</p>
<p>Systems Support Project</p>
<p>Purpose:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Offer questionnaires</li>
  <li>Produce reports</li>
  <li>Primary client behind CDA is "Jaguar Land Rover" (JLR)</li>
  <li>Works in multiple languages</li>
</ul>
<p>Languages:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Handled by a CSV based lexicon<ul>
      <li>These CSVs are provided by the customer but often contain errors, the CSV uploaded should be TAB separated but they often provide COMMA separated files.</li>
      <li>Corresponding information to the identifying markers of these lexicons is controlled by&nbsp; /BBWT.Web/app/translations/translate_default.json</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Essentially, markers exist which act almost as 'stand-ins' for the text on the site so it doesn't have to be hardcoded into the page. If no information about these markers is present in a lexicon CSV, it will default to English. These markers are easy to add to and typically semantic. ie:</p>
<p>SHARED.BUTTONS.PROCEED.TITLE</p>
<p>equal to</p>
<figure class="table">
  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <th>Proceed</th>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</figure>
<ul>
  <li>Lexicons are uploaded in the UI per Client under Manage Clients &gt; Select Client to Edit &gt; Lexicons &gt; Upload<ul>
      <li>Lexicons can also be downloaded from this location</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The "Clients" each contain their own lexicon, subdomain and branding<ul>
      <li>Branding determines the header logo, which if not specified would default to /Content/Images/cda-logo.png, logos should be 200x70 pixels</li>
      <li>Branding also determines colour scheme</li>
      <li>Subdomains for testing are in Route53, however the binding of subdomains is not determined by IIS, any domain can be associated with the server's Elastic IP<ul>
          <li>If no client exists, this would resolve to the default site</li>
          <li>If the client information contains the matching address used by the user, it will effectively "redirect".</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>There are 12 languages at present</li>
</ul>
<p>Reports:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reports can be produced as Word Documents or as PDF, PDF is preferred. This is handled by Docentric.<ul>
      <li>Docentric was recently upgraded to V6.0<ul>
          <li>This included a font component overhaul allowing for non-latin text</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Report designs are determined by a docx template with dynamic elements<ul>
          <li>CDA will not modify these dynamic elements but will often decide to modify fixed elements which can cause alignment issues on occasion</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>V6.0 seems to have a bug when dealing with JPEG elements<ul>
          <li>The current workaround is that we use PNG images exclusively, CDA are aware of this.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Minor fixed-element modifications:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A small amount of inline CSS is specified in the index.cshtml file, this is a quick and dirty patch-job to sort out some styling issues.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Blueberry Group : Q8-IVR Home&nbsp;</h1>
<p>Created by Jason Cozza on Nov 24, 2020</p>
<p><strong>Project Summary</strong></p>
<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>Current existing tool, WUG (WhatsUp Gold) provides a visual overview to IDS Network operations on the real time availability of IDS sites. Currently it can only be used for IDS owned sites and some sites with direct connection (P2H) to CHost. Nevertheless, is has been proven to be a vital IDS tool to enable the timely detection and correction of sites within current scope. A major proportion (70%) of sites is not connected to WUG and form a risk of late detection and recovery when unavailable. The still difficult to be controlled sites are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>all CA sites</li>
  <li>all H2H catered sites.</li>
</ul>
<p>The lack of real time monitoring capability is a business issue:</p>
<ul>
  <li>correction only occurs after customer complaint</li>
  <li>sites may have been unavailable for days/weeks/months undetected</li>
  <li>a site problem may actual be a host or routing problem where many sites are effected without direct notice. This leads to delayed and incorrect recovery actions.</li>
</ul>
<p>The missing sites can not directly be linked to WUG. WUG is IP based and inherently needs the site IP address. This address is in many cases not available:</p>
<ul>
  <li>for security or business reasons parties do not publish their IP address</li>
  <li>site is not reachable because it is in different network.</li>
</ul>
<h2>&nbsp;Solution</h2>
<p>By introducing a virtual router in the IDS network (further named IVR), where a physical network interface is assigned multiple IP addresses that are dynamically updated by [email] messages from IDS partners, whereas:</p>
<ul>
  <li>each created virtual IP address represents one site/terminal. If that IP address is available on the virtual router, then the site/terminal is available. If the site is not available, then the IP address is dropped by the virtual router.</li>
  <li>3rd party hosts already have facilities (commonly email based) where site availability is reported to customer by automatic servers. The WUG extension then picks up these messages, parses the contents and then adds or removes the virtual IP.</li>
  <li>all P2H sites already report on application level (IFSF network management messages) every 30 to 15 minutes to CHost their availability. This information can be reported by CGI to the IDS virtual router by email report.</li>
</ul>
<p>For information, IDS uses internally to identify site terminal by 6 characters:</p>
<ul>
  <li>ISO3166 alpha 2 to specify the county code (2 characters)</li>
  <li>extended with a 4 digit IDS site code,</li>
  <li>extended with a 2 digit code to identify the terminal.</li>

<p>To introduce the IVR into IDS, the following should be done:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Add in IDS network a virtual or physical server that caters following services:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>act as virtual router on IDS network</li>
      <li>act as mail/message server that receives site reports from specific 3rd parties</li>
      <li>interprets the 3rd part site reports to command a virtual router to set or reset corresponding IPs available.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Agree with 3rd parties on site message report format and service</li>
  <li>WUG to display site availability based on IP from virtual router.</li>

<h1>Blueberry Group : Scripts&nbsp;</h1>
<p>Created by Jason Cozza on Nov 24, 2020</p>
<p>This project will require several different scripts to manage various tasks and responsibilities. The scripts we know we'll need so far are:<br>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Email Monitor - Detect that new emails have come into the server, and start the parsing script.</li>
  <li>Parsing Script - Find terminal IDs (TIDs) from a given email, and update the database and alternative IP addresses based on whether those TIDs are in the online, or offline categories of the email.<br>This script also needs to check that if a TID match is found in the database, and the state in the email is the same as in the database, that the state of the alternative IP address for this TID is correct. E.g. An email comes in with "Online: ID000001" and the parser finds a match in the database for "ID000001", but that TID is already online - the parser needs to check to make sure that IP address is 'up' (i.e. online). (May need to rethink this though, not sure how easily Python can get the state of an alternate IP address).</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Blueberry Group : Check Retention Time&nbsp;</h1>
<p>Created by Jason Cozza on Nov 24, 2020</p>
<p>Simple SQL for calculating when all Terminals are offline for a site:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SELECT s.site_code,s.ip,s.site_status, sum(t.terminal_status)as c FROM `sites` as s</p>
<p>join terminals as t on s.site_code = t.site_code</p>
<p>group by s.site_code,s.ip,s.site_status</p>
<p>having c = 0</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Blueberry Group : Email Monitor Script&nbsp;</h1>
<p>Created by Jason Cozza on Nov 24, 2020</p>
<p><br>The email monitoring script will always be running under a daemon, watching a specific folder for new emails to come in:<br><br><i>inotifywait -m $eml_dir -e create -e moved_to |</i><br><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;while read path action file; do</i><br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a new email is detected, the script will create a log file for the current year, month, day and hour if a log does not already exist:</p>
<p><br><i>mkdir -p "$logs_dir/$cur_year/$cur_mon/$cur_day"</i><br><i>mkdir -p "$processed_dir/$cur_year/$cur_mon/$cur_day"</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br><i>if [ ! -f "$logs_dir/$cur_year/$cur_mon/$cur_day/$hour.log" ]; then</i><br><i>cat /dev/null &gt; "$logs_dir/$cur_year/$cur_mon/$cur_day/$hour.log"</i><br><i>fi</i><br>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The script logs that a new email has been detected:</p>
<p><br><i>echo "$time - New e-mail (Email_$time.eml) recieved" &gt;&gt; "$logs_dir/$cur_year/$cur_mon/$cur_day/$hour.log"</i></p>
<p><br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and finally runs the Python parser script.<br><br><i>python ~/scripts/parser.py "$eml_dir/$file" "Email_$time.eml" "$logs_dir/$cur_year/$cur_mon/$cur_day/$hour.log" ${debug_level}</i><br><i>done</i></p>
<p><br>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Email Monitor Daemon</h2>
<p>Commands:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Start service:&nbsp;<i>sudo systemctl start ivr-monitor.service</i></li>
  <li>Stop service:&nbsp;<i>sudo systemctl stop ivr-monitor.service</i></li>
  <li>Restart service:&nbsp;<i>sudo systemctl restart ivr-monitor.service</i></li>
  <li>View Logs:&nbsp;<i>sudo journalctl -u ivr-monitor.service</i></li>
  <li>Reload daemon if changes are made to the ivr-monitor.service file: <i>systemctl daemon-reload</i></li>
</ul>
<p><br>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Logging Levels</h2>
<p>The logging level can be passed to the email monitor script as a parameter, this needs to be specified in the <i>ivr-monitor.service</i> file, located in the directory:&nbsp;<i>/lib/systemd/system.</i></p>
<p>The following line:&nbsp;<i>ExecStart=/opt/ivr-monitor/scripts/email_monitor.sh -</i>&nbsp;can have parameters added to the end of the line, like so:<br><br><i>ExecStart=/opt/ivr-monitor/scripts/email_monitor.sh&nbsp;2&nbsp;</i></p>
<p><br>Different logging levels can be passed as a number, if no parameter is passed then the script assumes a default logging level of basic error logging.</p>
<p>The logging levels are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>-1: Basic error logging, the default state</li>
  <li>0: Logging completely disabled</li>
  <li>1: "Verbose" logging</li>
  <li>2: "Verbose" logging with script start/stop/total execution time shown</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Breakdown of the parsing process:</p>
<ol>
  <li>A bash script (<i>monitor_emails.sh</i>) on the server detects when new email files come in to the new email folder. This script then runs the actual python parser script.</li>
  <li>The script attempts to open a file, whose file path is passed to the script as an argument. I.e. when the script is run, the command to run the script is as follows:<br><br><i>python parser.py [path to email file]</i><br><br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>The text of the email’s body is broken down into a list of the lines, we evaluate each line to see if it's a comment line (denoted by the line beginning with '(*' and ending with '*)'), if it is, it can be ignored:<br>*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************<br># Get the message text from the email as a string<br>body_text = eml.get_payload()<br><br># Split the message body into a list of lines, as we need to evaluate each line to check if they are a comment<br>body_lines = body_text.splitlines()<br><br>body_text = []<br><br># Lines beginning with (* and ending with *) are comments, and can be discarded<br>for i in body_lines:<br>if i[:2] != '(*' and i[-2:] == '*)':<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; body_text.append(i)*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************</li>
  <li>The remaining lines are then recombined into a single string, special characters in the ascii value range 1 to 47 are removed, along with the semicolon character (ascii value: 59), and the whole thing is then split into a list of individual words:<br>***************************************************************************************************************# Concatenate all elements from the list into a single string<br>if type(body_text) is list:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; body_text = ', '.join(str(v) for v in body_text)<br><br># Remove delimiters, and split the body text into individual words<br>for i in range(1, 48):<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; body_text = body_text.replace(str(unichr(i)), ' ')body_text = body_text.replace(';', ' ').split()<br>***************************************************************************************************************<br><br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Each word is evaluated to find either “Online:” or “Offline:” keywords, or “[2 Upper case characters][6 digit number]” terminal IDs (TIDs). If the online / offline keywords are found, any subsequent TIDs are stored in a list, corresponding to which keyword was evaluated most recently.</li>
  <li><i><strong>Pseudo Code for this process:</strong></i>
    <ol>
      <li><i>For each word in the email body:</i><br>
        <ol>
          <li><i>If the word is online: Activate the online list to receive subsequent TIDs</i></li>
          <li><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the word is offline: Activate the offline list to receive subsequent TIDs</i></li>
          <li><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the word begins with two upper case characters (ascii range 65 - 90) and is 8 characters long: add it to the currently activated list.</i></li>
          <li><i>&nbsp;<strong>* </strong>If the word begins with two upper case characters&nbsp;(ascii range 65 - 90)&nbsp;and is not 8 characters long: send an error notification.</i></li>
          <li><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the word does not match any of the above: ignore it.</i><br><i>* Planned, not yet implemented.</i><br><i>&nbsp;</i></li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>The script then connects to the MySQL database, and updates the relevant rows on the “Status Table”, to reflect any terminal status changes made by the email:<br><br><i><strong>My Code:</strong></i><br>cur.execute("UPDATE Status_table SET Status=\"Online\", Last_Changed=" +<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; datetime.datetime.now() + " WHERE TID=" + on[2:])OR<br>cur.execute("UPDATE Status_table SET Status=\"Offline\", Last_Changed=" +<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; datetime.datetime.now() + " WHERE TID=" + on[2:])<br><br><i><strong>Explanation:</strong></i><br>The above lines of code execute an SQL statement on the MySQL database, where the “status” (online or offline) of a terminal, specified by the TID (terminal ID), is updated to the correct value (depending on which “keyword” preceded it most recently).</li>
  <li>Finally, the python script makes a system call, which tells Ubuntu to set an IP address to being “up”, or “down” depending on whether the associated TID is online or offline respectively. If an IP address is “up” that IP address can be locally “pinged”, it cannot be “pinged” however, if that IP address is “down. The system call from Python looks like this:<br><br>call(["ifconfig", "eth0:" + eth0_addr, ip, "netmask", "255.255.255.0", "up"]) to set an IP address as "up"<br>ORcall(["ifconfig", "eth0:" + eth0_addr, ip, "netmask", "255.255.255.0", "down"]) to set an IP address as "down"</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Debugging</strong></h2>
<p>Various levels of debugging can be enabled via passing an argument to the email monitoring Bash script. By default, if no argument is passed, debugging will assume that errors should be logged and support emails should be sent when errors are detected. The following codes are arguments which can be passed to enable different debugging levels than the standard - only log errors - debugging level:</p>
<ul>
  <li>0 : Completely disable logging</li>
  <li>1 : Enable comprehensive logging (i.e. When emails were received, when email parsing starts, when it finishes, if all IP addresses had matches found in the database, if the terminal statuses were updated successfully)</li>
  <li>2 : Comprehensive logging, with additional logs to measure how long certain parts of the script take to ru</li>
</ul>

<h1>Blueberry Group : Parser - Specific email format tweaks&nbsp;</h1>
<p>Created by Jason Cozza on Nov 24, 2020</p>
<h2>Sterling Petromani Emails</h2>
<p>Emails from Sterling Petromani do not have the Content-Transfer-Encoding specified in the header of the email, therefore the parser must look in the email body for this:<br><br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>if "Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64" in body_text:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; body_text = base64.decodestring(body_text.split("Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64", 1)[-1])<br><br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>in order to correctly decode it, the parser must remove the part of the email body, before and up to the "Content-Transfer-Encoding" line.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Blueberry Group : Unit Testing&nbsp;</h1>
<p>Created by Jason Cozza on Nov 24, 2020</p>
<p>There are two different scripts used for unit testing - "unit_test.py" and "bulk_unit_test.py" on the virtual router, they should always be located in the "/home/ubuntu/scripts/" directory. These unit tests ensure that the system performs all of it's necessary functions, i.e. updating the database to reflect the status of terminals given in emails, putting relevant IP addresses online or offline and creating system logs; they also ensure that errors are identified correctly. Any time a change is made to the "parser.py" script, these unit test files should be run to ensure that previous functionality was not affected by the changes. Both unit test scripts send emails, which contain reserved IP addresses, so that these tests do not interfere with any real TIDs; generally speaking, the "unit_test.py" script sends emails with only a few terminal ID numbers, in order to test the core functionality of the system; whereas many of the tests in the "bulk_unit_test.py" script use between 10 and 20 TIDs in their testing emails.&nbsp;<br><br>The process for enabling the unit tests is as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Ensure that the "Unit Test Code" region of the "parser.py" script is uncommented, i.e. at the top and bottom of the code block, there are three single quotation marks - these need to be removed in order to allow the unit test scripts to function correctly.</li>
  <li>Ensure that the logging level of the Email Monitor Script is set to 1 or 2. The details of how to change the logging level can be found here:&nbsp;<a href="Email-Monitor-Script_85493788.html">Email Monitor Script</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The unit tests can be run with the command "sudo python unit_test.py&nbsp;[unit test type]" or&nbsp;"sudo python bulk_unit_test.py&nbsp;[unit test type]" where "unit test type" is a number from 0 to 2, indicating the formatting of the emails that the unit tests send.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The email formats available are:</p>
<p>0 - Plain Text<br>1 - HTML<br>2 - Rich Text</p>
<p>So in order to run the "unit_test.py" tests where the emails are formatted as HTML you would run the command as:<br><br><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; sudo python unit_test.py 1</i></p>
<p>or if you wanted to run the "bulk_unit_test.py" tests where the emails are formatted as Rich Text, you would run the command as:<br><br><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; sudo python bulk_unit_test.py 2</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If no number is specified when running the script, it will default to sending the emails as plain text.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Blueberry Group : Updating the Database&nbsp;</h1>
<p>Created by Jason Cozza on Nov 24, 2020</p>
<p>There is a simple script to update the database using a CSV file in the "/home/ubuntu/scripts/" directory, called "update_database.py". This can be run with the following command:</p>
<p>"<i>sudo python update_database.py&nbsp;[name of your csv file]</i>"&nbsp;e.g. "sudo python update_database.py vrouter_table.csv".<br><br>The script will display an error message if it is run without a CSV file specified as an argument.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Blueberry Group : Uploading New File Versions&nbsp;</h1>
<p>Created by Jason Cozza on Nov 24, 2020</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to upload new files to the Q8 live server, you'll need to sign into the Q8 network and then connect to the server via PuTTY (<a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html">Latest PuTTY release</a>) and PSFTP (Included in the PuTTY installer). Connecting via PuTTY is straightforward as it has a GUI which should look like:</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493794/85493798.png"></figure>
<p>The up-to-date IP address and port number are in LastPass under the Q8 IVR SSH note in the BB-Shared-Customers\Q8 folder. Once the details have been entered, click "Open" to connect to the server, you'll be prompted to enter the username and password into the terminal which are also found in the Q8 IVR SSH note. Once you've logged you can use the terminal to interact with the server's shell (I'll come back to this).</p>
<p>Then log into the server with PSFTP, do this by opening a Command Prompt in Windows, and then typing "PSFTP [IP Address]&nbsp;-P [Port Number]" so it should look like this:&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493794/85493795.png"></figure>
<p>Again, you'll be prompted for a username and password, which are the same as in the Q8 IVR SSH note. Once you've logged in, you can upload files from your local PC to the server using the "put [Filename]" command, you can navigate to different directories on your local computer using the "lcd&nbsp;[Directory name]" command and you can navigate to different directories on the server using the standard "cd" command.</p>
<p>On the live server, I recommend uploading the files you're changing to the home directory, and then moving them from there to where they need to be, in order to avoid permission issues when uploading via PSFTP. The parser.py file needs to be moved from the home directory to the "/opt/ivr-monitor/scripts/" directory once it's been ftp'd over; assuming the daemon service is still running, all you should need to do is move the file over and it should just work as normal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, for the following files, you'll need to change the values of the database password inside the scripts (You can edit the files on the server using "sudo nano [filename]") in order to ensure that they work on the Live server, as the versions on SVN use the database password for the test server:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Server Web Files/index.php</li>
  <li>Python Scripts/bulk_unit_test.py</li>
  <li>Python Scripts/parser.py</li>
  <li>Python Scripts/unit_test.py</li>
  <li>Python Scripts/update_database.py</li>
</ul>
<p>The database password can be found in the Q8 IVR SSH note in LastPass.</p>

</ol>
<h1>BUG NOTICE:</h1>
<p>If device reboots after step 5.e. and indicates through audio that no user has been found a second reboot by holding the button for &gt; 10 seconds will often fix this issue.</p>
<p>If you hold the button for under 10 seconds it will remove the user settings and a setup will have to take place again.</p>
<h2>Use case – setting up with a different account</h2>
<p>Set up is the same as above but at step 5 when a user is found go to step 5.a.</p>
<h2>Use case – day to day use after setup</h2>
<p>If the device has been fully setup, day to day use will be powering up the device, device will log in to users account and Spotify and a click of the button will play/stop the music that has been pre-set in the default playlist on the oobeedoo dashboard.</p>
<p>If the device cannot connect to the WIFI it will alert the user through and audio warning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Button Controls</h1>
<p>Single button press – will play/stop music if logged in if not will give audio instructions to sign in.</p>
<p>Button hold for 5 seconds – Device will go into setup mode, step (5.a.).</p>
<p>Button hold for more than 10 seconds – Device will soft reboot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Code and Issues</h1>
<h2>Main Current Issue:</h2>
<p>Once a device has been connected and gone through the setup process it will not retain the user credentials. Although this is somewhat not true as the device will often still connect to the local Wi-Fi correctly,</p>
<p>therefore the device is holding at least the Wi-Fi information but the program is not recognising this on reboot (step 5.e. + 6.).</p>
<p>On occasion this can be subverted by holding the device button for more than 10 seconds calling a soft reboot (sudo shutdown -r now). Once the device has rebooted it will then recognise the account and sign in.</p>
<h2>Possible Causes:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>The device on boot could be passing the code of signing in before the device has had time to connect to the internet therefore not being able to verify the account it will assert no details recognised.</li>
  <li>A previous bug caused the resin Wi-Fi connect (step 5.c.) to never close, this meant that after a user signed in the instructions and next process (step 5.c.iv) would never happen.&nbsp;<br>It was concluded from looking at the PI’s running processes that this was holding the device in a lock therefore killing the process after the details has been taken fixed this. But this may have caused this to be unstable.&nbsp;<br>Tests at the developers WFH location on 3 different Wi-Fi networks passed, yet this may be causing the issue for the speaker manufacture. Could be killing the process before the details have been stored.<br>Location on device ‘/oobeedoo/src/oobeedoo_player.py’. Code Lines ~258 – 262.<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493802/85493803.png"></figure>
<ol>
  <li>User details are wrong and the code only asserts details not found through audio instructions.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Connection</h1>
<p>Device will display its IP address on screen upon boot.</p>
<p>From Terminal:</p>
<p>SSH pi@IPAddress</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Passwords</h1>
<p>The main Password for the device is contained within the company Bit-Warden.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Things to note</h1>
<p><i>Display</i> - Pi may not display on older screens due to the HDMI configs, plugging into a tv often works.</p>
<p><i>Volume</i> – Volume of the device is not constant/consistent, although this is set during the setup in the main python code to be 80% and the firebase values are set to around this it reverts to a much lower volume inconsitantly.</p>
<p><i>Audio</i> – Audio often contains artefacts on start-up.</p>
<p><i>IMG</i> – IMG for the software is bloated, it sits at 32GB but this is mainly empty space it can be taken down to around 4GB by deleting the empty space.</p>
<p><i>Website</i> – The website will only allow one playlist for music, will also create an additional device every time the oobeedoo is set up on the account it will not replace duplicate devices.</p>
<p>Therefore when on each time setting the device up you will have to find the newest device and connect that to the Spotify.</p>
<p>Note: Change the name of each device you add to a number so you can see the new device which will always be named Oobeedoo.</p>
