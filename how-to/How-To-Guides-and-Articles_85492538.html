<h1>Contacting System Administrators&nbsp;</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For urgent/critical issues or tasks, contact sysadmins via email at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:sysadmins@bbconsult.co.uk">sysadmins@bbconsult.co.uk</a>.</p>
<p>A non-exhaustive list of things which sysadmins consider urgent:</p>
<ul>
  <li>System failure (production system: database, infrastructure, server, etc.).</li>
  <li>Overdue task.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your task does not fit into the above, continue with this guide.</p>
<p>Be reasonable about task deadlines. For example, if you've decided to submit a task on the day that it needs to be completed when it could have been submitted a week prior, please don't be offended if a sysadmin says that it can't be prioritised. Simply setting something as urgent in PTS won't make it move any quicker, and if it's truly urgent you should be using email.</p>
<p>Sysadmins appreciate that customers can make things difficult with regards to scheduling, but do try to leave as much time for completion as possible.</p>
<p>Do consider whether the task you are submitting is actually for sysadmins. For example, if it's an issue with PTS you should contact Carl Smith or Oliver Goodman.</p>
<h2>Step-by-step guide</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Open&nbsp;<a href="https://pts.bbconsult.co.uk">PTS</a><br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Click the&nbsp;<strong>Contact Sys Admins</strong>&nbsp;button at the top-right corner of any page.<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493811/85493812.png?effects=drop-shadow"></figure>
<ol>
  <li>Fill out the form as desired.<br>If your work is project specific, then remember to select it.<br>Try to include as much information as possible in the&nbsp;<strong>Further supporting information</strong> field to reduce the time taken for work to begin on the task.<br>You can suggest who should take up the task by mentioning them in the&nbsp;<strong>Further supporting information</strong>&nbsp;field.</li>
  <li>Click&nbsp;<strong>Send</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can create a task/issue/ticket as normal in PTS and assign the&nbsp;<strong>Sys Admins</strong> group to ensure they receive it.</p>
<h2>Key points</h2>
<p>Sys admins will automatically be informed of the new task and will delegate it internally.</p>
<p>When they want you to respond to the task, they will set the status to&nbsp;<strong>Waiting for End-User</strong>.</p>
<p>When you've responded and want them to respond or continue work, set the status to&nbsp;<strong>Waiting for Manager/Tester</strong> or&nbsp;<strong>Waiting for Developer team</strong>.</p>
<p>Respond to tasks as quickly as possible so things can move quicker.</p>
<p>Don't split discussion of a PTS task into email unless it has evolved into an urgent task. Sysadmins will simply direct you to use the PTS task if you try this.</p>
<p>If you feel that your task has been ignored (no responsible set, or no initial follow up), do send out a&nbsp;reminder&nbsp;to&nbsp;sysadmins@bbconsult.co.uk.</p>
<p>Try to keep the task on-topic. If the task drifts away from the original topic and the task requirements were fulfilled, sysadmins will likely close it as completed so you should create a new task with new requirements if required.</p>
<h1>Adding certificates to Outlook&nbsp;</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this guide, the instructions are for&nbsp;<strong>Firefox,&nbsp;Windows 7</strong>&nbsp;(but in general any Windows OS should do as long as you have Firefox) and&nbsp;<strong>Outlook 2010</strong>&nbsp;(again, instructions should work with Outlook 2013/2016 but YMMV)</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open Firefox and navigate to this link (or google “comodo Free Email Certificate”):<a href="https://secure.instantssl.com/products/frontpage?area=SecureEmailCertificate&amp;currency=GBP&amp;region=United+Kingdom&amp;country=GB&amp;entryURL=https%3A//www.instantssl.com/ssl-certificate-products/free-email-certificate.html%3Fkey5sk1%3Dacf158e8c19b27189e0a7faab9dcbb80d9af199b&amp;referrerURL=https%3A//www.comodo.com/home/email-security/free-email-certificate.php">&nbsp;https://secure.instantssl.com/products/frontpage?area=SecureEmailCertificate</a><br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Fill in the details. The most important parts are the email address and the revocation certificate. You will then get the following screen:<br><br><br>&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493484/85493485.png"></figure>
<ol>
  <li>Open your email and click on the link to confirm that you own the email address. You won’t get the certificate unless you can prove you manage the email.<br><br><br>&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493484/85493486.png"></figure>
<ol>
  <li>You will then get the certificate installed in your browser (Firefox).<br><br><br>&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493484/85493487.png"></figure>
<ol>
  <li>Navigate to Firefox properties toolbar and pick Advanced, then pick View Certificates.<br><br><br>&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493484/85493488.png"></figure>
<ol>
  <li>Your email certificate will be installed under “Your Certificates”.<br><br><br>&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493484/85493489.png"></figure>
<ol>
  <li>Click on “View” to see the certificate to verify.<br><br><br>&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493484/85493490.png"></figure>
<ol>
  <li>Once you have verified that the subject matches your email, backup the certificate to disk (i.e. export to file)<br><br><br>&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493484/85493491.png"></figure>
<ol>
  <li>You will be asked to password-protect the file, do it.<br><br><br>&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493484/85493492.png"></figure>
<ol>
  <li>You will then get confirmation:<br><br><br>&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493484/85493493.png"></figure>
<ol>
  <li>Next, the certificate needs to be imported in to Outlook. Open Outlook, go to Options and then Trust Centre and Trust Centre Settings.<br><br>&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493484/85493494.png"></figure>
<ol>
  <li>Click “E-mail Security” and “Import/Export” and pick the file that you exported the certificate to. Also provide the password which you used when backing up (exporting) the file. Digital ID names should be your name or your email.<br><br>&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493484/85493495.png"></figure>
<ol>
  <li>The following screen will follow, click OK.<br><br>&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493484/85493496.png"></figure>
<ol>
  <li>Confirm that you want to install the certificate<br><br>&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493484/85493497.png"></figure>
<ol>
  <li>Change from SHA1 to SHA2 (or SHA5) but don’t change anything else.<br><br>&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493484/85493498.png"></figure>
<ol>
  <li>The certificate should now have been imported. Send a signed test email to confirm - see the screenshot below, under Options tick the “Sign” section, and send. Do not tick “Encrypt”..<br><br>&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493484/85493499.png"></figure>
<p>Allow Outlook to access the key (it’s already imported but Outlook cannot use it unless you grant permission).</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493484/85493500.png"></figure>
<ol>
  <li>After the test email is sent, open your BB email to see if you’ve got mail. See below, it’s marked as signed, and there is a valid signature.<br><br>&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493484/85493501.png"></figure>
<p>This email was manually signed by clicking the “Sign” icon. Instead this can be enabled to be applied by default, see the screenshot below:<br><br>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493484/85493502.png"></figure>
<p>Remember the revocation key that was specified on the Comodo website? That can be used to revoke the certificate if need be. The revocation link is in the original email from Comodo.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Click on the link<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493484/85493503.png"></figure>

<h1>Assuming a cross-account role in the AWS Console&nbsp;</h1>
<p>You may need to assume a cross-account role from your main login in Blueberry's AWS account. This is considered more secure than having different, isolated logins across AWS accounts.</p>
<h2>Step-by-step guide</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>Login to your Blueberry AWS account as normal using&nbsp;<a href="https://blueberry.signin.aws.amazon.com/console">this link</a>.</li>
  <li>Click your account name in the top-right, and select&nbsp;<strong>Switch Role</strong>.<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493511/85493512.png?effects=drop-shadow"></figure>
<ol>
  <li>Follow the instructions and fill out with information given to you by your administrator.<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493511/85493513.png?effects=drop-shadow"></figure>
<ol>
  <li>For example for PKF Cooper Parry customer AWS account you need to set it up like it is shown below:<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493511/85493514.png"></figure>
<p>You may also construct a URL for your convenience to assume the role i.e.&nbsp;<a href="https://signin.aws.amazon.com/switchrole?roleName=ROLE_NAME&amp;account=ACCOUNT_ID_OR_ALIAS">https://signin.aws.amazon.com/switchrole?roleName=ROLE_NAME&amp;account=ACCOUNT_ID_OR_ALIAS</a>&nbsp;- substitute the role name and account id/alias as appropriate.</p>
<h1>AWS Lamdba&nbsp;</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Create Lamdba Function and Deploy Python Backup scriptss&nbsp;</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Create Lamdba Function</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before deploying Lamdba Backup functions you should create it first by following instructions below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open Amazon web console and then click on services, then click on&nbsp;<strong>Lamdba</strong></li>
  <li>Click on Create Function and then click on "batch-get-job-python27", then you are going to see "Configure triggers" GUI, then click&nbsp;<strong>Next</strong></li>
  <li>Fill the information below, like it is shown on the screenshots below:<br><br><br><br>Make sure to use the name of the lambda function here before the ".lambda_handler" text<br><br><br>On Advanced settings Tab make sure to use 5 min, at the time of this writting it is&nbsp; maximum execution time<br><br><br>&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493524/85493527.png"></figure>

<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493524/85493525.png"></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Deploy Python Backup scripts</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To deploy files&nbsp;<strong>ConsumerCoreBBBackupScript.py</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>ProducerCoreBBBackupScript.py</strong>&nbsp;follow the instructions below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>Log in on the ubuntu server called test-ansible</li>
</ol>
<p>Execute the command "sudo -i"</p>
<p>Execute the command "cd lambda"</p>
<ol>
  <li>Update the code of the files&nbsp;<strong>ConsumerCoreBBBackupScript.py</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>ProducerCoreBBBackupScript.py</strong></li>
  <li>To deploy the file called&nbsp;<strong>ProducerCoreBBBackupScript.py&nbsp;</strong>execute the script called&nbsp;<strong>deployProducerCoreBBBackupScript.sh</strong></li>
  <li>To deploy the file called&nbsp;<strong>ConsumerCoreBBBackupScript.py&nbsp;</strong>execute the script called&nbsp;<strong>deployConsumerCoreBBBackupScript.sh</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Create or Modify existing CloudWatch rules responsible to execute Lamdba Backup scripts&nbsp;</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At present we have 2 python scripts, one of them it is called&nbsp;<strong>Producer</strong>&nbsp;and it is going to put all volumes of all AWS accounts that are going to be snapshotted withing the SQS queue called&nbsp;<strong>Level1_Backup_Script&nbsp;</strong>for 24H backups and it is going to use&nbsp;Level2_Backup_Script queue in order to process 4H backups,&nbsp; <strong>Consumer</strong>&nbsp;code it is going be executed every 10 min&nbsp; by retrieving messages of the queue within the 5 minutes maximum execution time due to a known lamdba limitation, this design&nbsp; allow that all volumes get snapshotted bit a bit in order to avoid getting the&nbsp;<strong>RequestLimitExceeded&nbsp; </strong>AWS exception,&nbsp; see more information on the URL below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?messageID=720883">https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?messageID=720883</a></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both Producer and Consumer are designed to receive a parameter in Json format called&nbsp;<strong>BackupFrequency</strong>&nbsp; by passing either "4H" or "24H" parameters which is going to instruct the scripts whether it should process either 24H or 4H backups,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>How to Modify a CloudWatch&nbsp;rule?</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open AWS console and then click on Services and then click on Cloudwatch which is located under Managment tool like it is shown in the screenshoot below&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493530/85493531.png"></figure>
<ol>
  <li>Then Click on Rules and then Click on any of the rules below<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493530/85493532.png"></figure>
<p>3. Then Click on Actions and then Click on Edit and you are going to see the screenshot below.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493530/85493533.png"></figure>

<h1>Create Tesseract Lambda Function&nbsp;</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<h2>Layer</h2>
<p>The function requires certain libraries as well as the Tesseract binary.</p>
<p>It uses&nbsp;Python3.6&nbsp;as runtime.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/igcNhl8SMA-TZDtX3V6TF37gNAQ-4CKNEFW-h33iJYMQSYNvFoSCNdqTVnmA_UYjOq7WSDfi_3zES98wz-rXi-t4jFRNXc86Cal8b1AN1x2w-e3t1Tr3OZvh5ug0-RR_hGtdCnoB"></figure>
<p>This layer can be uploaded from&nbsp;layer.zip.</p>
<p>The tesseract binary was generated by following this guide:<br><a href="https://github.com/gwittchen/lambda-ocr">https://github.com/gwittchen/lambda-ocr</a></p>
<h2>Function</h2>
<p>The code for the function can be found in the&nbsp;function&nbsp;folder.</p>
<p>It uses&nbsp;Python3.6&nbsp;as runtime.</p>
<h3>Function Role</h3>
<p>The function needs the following permissions:</p>
<p>AmazonS3FullAccess</p>
<p>AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/iK8--HW19FEsKnRldUrmqmZxXLlpkyC278vULyF2umWsxyrHIkjfjBCT0BsHEP4pJl5Ea6sKNQ0YBVU021yOGZ4wZiCuFqkr2rQzX9P-m9MGuRu3sr_RhATVcx_cmkTaYtg3r1RF"></figure>
<h3>Settings</h3>
<p>The function might timeout if the basic settings are left unchanged. It will need more memory as well.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/UOWYubeXMX8f-EahL_7VfqJ5kgJ42lyQGRLizjIH7_dgdU4Z3z3jKo0kcT6SiYifsiIHW7N7Nb9FvGlUmlex18qGJlbEUdEwXkG4u0gxbvOcrQ_-L7eFCsGlISjD4vbKbmlBy3TY"></figure>
<h3>Result</h3>
<p>The function generates a text file out of the image in the same bucket and same directory.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/HzNXBBVWxatPE-ufG-Mr6ycVGIJNlnaKu9rOJ39EQuka9xhkYt8tAwX6CMtux5W55pnCtxXz1JYJnSXlqkCHxt7syc1SszVwmiJOX4FDUGGXJagLjXq9UXd6tAnGr4xAe5OkZAym"></figure>
<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>The function uses a copy of Tesseract TrainedData. This is not ideal and should be changed.</p>
<p>The function must be in the same region as the S3 Bucket in order to add triggers.</p>
<h1>BB Mail setup and using&nbsp;</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Attaching Emails for SysAdmins&nbsp;</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are having issues with mails, SysAdmins will need a copy of the bounce / original email so that they can see the headers.<br><br>To do this:</p>

<h1>BlueSprints (Refresher for Blueberry Systems PMs currently)&nbsp;</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="attachments/85493553/85493554.jpg"></figure>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>How blue am I? Here’s your checklist! Here are a few BlueSprints things you should be doing, and this now applies to all projects, except those that are 95% completed e.g. MCA Control Room, Where’s Free.</strong><br><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>USE LEVEL 1 TO LEVEL 3 TASKS</strong><br>&nbsp;<br>Your Task Tree in PTS should have three levels. Level 1 Tasks are the customer’s requirements – the “what”, Level 2 Tasks are your design response to each requirement – the “how”. There may be one or more Level 2 Tasks for each Level 1. Level 3 Tasks are the work instructions for the developers. There may be one or more Level 3 Tasks per Level 2.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>MAKE YOUR REQUIREMENTS “USER STORIES”</strong><br>&nbsp;<br>Level 1 Tasks are your requirements and they should typically be expressed in customer user language. Ideally they will be written by the customer, but sometimes they will be the result of a workshop session with the customer. Nevertheless, they should be in a format such as “I want a page where I can view and update information about any of my suppliers” or perhaps “The system must have a page for listing and editing suppliers”. The exact format is flexible but each requirement should be atomic, clear and complete.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>IDENTIFY YOUR PRODUCT OWNER</strong><br>&nbsp;<br>You should identify which one person within the customer organisation owns the requirements. This is the Product Owner. It may or may not be the same person as the customer’s Project Manager. Really, it needs to be the person who the system is for and who can make executive decisions about what they want from the software. Examples would be Cliff at Uvex, Amelia at EE, David at Hudson, ? at RCO (interesting one – forces the customer to decide who is ultimately in charge of the spec!). You can set the Product Owner role in PTS the customer contact grid. Once set up, this person can see Tasks for approval in the Portal.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>GET LEVEL 1 AND LEVEL 2 TASKS APPROVED BY THE CUSTOMER IN THE PORTAL</strong><br>&nbsp;<br>Firstly, make sure that you set up your customer with Portal access at the start of the project. This is a startup activity. As you create your requirements (Level 1 Tasks) and design (Level 2 Tasks) you should set the status to “WFCA” (Waiting For Customer Approval). These Tasks will then appear to the customer’s Product Owner in the Portal, where they can add comments and approve them.<br>&nbsp;<br>You don’t need to produce a spec document – unless the customer explicitly wants one, in which case we have a document template that can be used where an export of the Level 1 and 2 Tasks from PTS can be inserted.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>MAKE A RISK LOG – AND CHECK IT WEEKLY!</strong><br>&nbsp;<br>Every project should have a Risk Log created at the start of the project and checked/updated weekly. We will be introducing a tool called PRISM soon to help you tease out where the project risks are. Remember that a Risk Log is totally useless unless you make an action plan to mitigate each risk – and review the Log and Actions weekly.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>CREATE A DEVELOPMENT CATALOGUE</strong><br>&nbsp;<br>Once your Level 1 and Level 2 Tasks are approved by the Customer, you can create the corresponding Level 3 Tasks. These are the actual work packages for the developers. Each L3 Task should be small (max 2 days work) and well defined. You should agree an estimate with the developer that you are both happy with, erring on the pessimistic side. Each of these Tasks should then be set to status DCAT (Development Catalogue) so they are ready to be allocated to a Sprint.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>PLAN OUT YOUR SPRINTS</strong><br>&nbsp;<br>Once your Development Catalogue is complete, it is ideal to plan out ALL of your Sprints. Of course, Sprints will change and new Sprints will be added as the project progresses, but by starting off with an initial set of planned Sprints, including all DCAT Tasks, you are effectively creating a project plan for the development work.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>SET UP SPRINTS WITH A FIXED DURATION AND LEAVE 20% CONTINGENCY</strong><br>&nbsp;<br>Setting up a Sprint has these steps:-</p>
<ol>
  <li>Decide the duration. The duration must be no more than 3 weeks. 1 or 2 weeks should be normal.</li>
  <li>Identify what developer resources you have and their availability, taking into account holidays and their involvement in other work. This gives you a number of available developer hours.</li>
  <li>Set at least 20% contingency in your Sprint.</li>
  <li>Allocate Tasks from your Development Catalogue to the Sprint until all the available time is used (excluding the contingency).</li>
</ol>
<p><br>&nbsp;<br>Example:-</p>
<ol>
  <li>My Sprint will be 2 weeks (10 working days)</li>
  <li>I have two developers. There is a Russian bank holiday within the Sprint and one of my devs is needed for two days on another project. So that gives me 9 days for one developer, and 7 for the other. Total 16 days – 128 hours.</li>
  <li>I set contingency at 20% so 26 hours is not available for allocating – it’s there for fixing problems, handling overruns etc.</li>
  <li>I allocate Tasks to the Sprint to fill up the remaining 102 hours based on estimates I agreed with my devs.</li>
</ol>
<p><br>&nbsp;<br><strong>HAVE A DAILY REVIEW WITH YOUR DEVS AND UPDATE YOUR ESTIMATES</strong><br>&nbsp;<br>Each morning, talk to your devs on Skype. Focusing on the Tasks they are working on, ask them “What did you do yesterday?”, “What are you planning to do today?”, “Is the Task on target or are there any impediments requiring a re-estimate?”. Record progress against your estimates and this will feed into your Burndown Chart. Currently, we are using a spreadsheet for this but hopefully it will soon be possible to do this in PTS.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>USE BURNDOWN CHARTS AND SHOW THEM IN THE TEAM STANDUP</strong><br>&nbsp;<br>By updating estimates with the devs every day, you will update your Burndown Chart. Show this in your Team Standup when reporting project progress on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Also, you can show it to your customer unless there is a good reason not to. In the future, it will be made available to the customer through the Portal.</p>

<h1>Checking the broadband status using pfSense&nbsp;</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you notice slowness in the internet speed you're getting, there could be packet loss or other issues with the main CoreSpeed line.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can check CoreSpeed's status at&nbsp;<a href="https://status.corespeed.cloud/">https://status.corespeed.cloud</a>.</p>
<p>You can check Andrews and Arnold's status at&nbsp;<a href="http://aastatus.net/">http://aastatus.net/</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Corespeed has 60Mbps down, 30Mbps up.</p>
<p>Andrews and Arnold's has 8Mbps down, 1Mbps up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Step-by-step guide</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Navigate to&nbsp;<a href="https://10.16.1.1:8080/">https://10.16.1.1:8080</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://mt-hq.bbconsult.co.uk:8080/">https://mt-hq.bbconsult.co.uk:8080</a>. Accept any certificate warnings.</li>
  <li>Use the BitWarden note 'pfSense Consult HQ (office-user)'.</li>
  <li>Observe the dashboard, in particular the interface and gateway statuses. WAN_PPPOE is the main CoreSpeed line, while WANAA_PPPOE is the backup Andrews and Arnold line.<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<ol>
  <li>When the main line is down or experiencing severe packet loss, pfSense will route traffic through the backup line.</li>
  <li>If the main line is down, give CoreSpeed a call and give them an estimate of when the outage occurred.</li>
  <li>If the main line is experiencing a lot of packet loss, it might be worth calling them to find out what's going on.</li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Updates</h3>
<p>You can now configure the wifi on this laptop and check for any updates, install every updates on this devices.</p>
<h3>Office tools (Word, Excel, Powerpoint)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Exit all your Office applications such as Outlook, Word, Excel, Powerpoint.</li>
  <li>Download o2019.zip ( <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KvDdFwFh7akKQg3TT5-7bIYHiPxjgmSg/view?usp=sharing">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KvDdFwFh7akKQg3TT5-7bIYHiPxjgmSg/view?usp=sharing</a>)&nbsp;(2GB download, 3GB when uncompressed, you need 10GB free space)</li>
  <li>From the Start menu, type File and open File Explorer</li>
  <li>Navigate to your Downloads folder. Confirm that you can see o2019.zip</li>
  <li>Double-click o2019.zip . Use the provided password. You should see the o2019 folder inside it.</li>
  <li>Select the o2019 folder and copy it by holding down the CTRL key&nbsp;and pressing C</li>
  <li>Select the Back or Up icons so that you return to the Downloads folder</li>
  <li>Paste the o2019 folder by holding down the CTRL key and pressing V</li>
  <li>The o2019 folder should now be inside the Downloads folder</li>
  <li>Start a command prompt (black window) by pressing the Windows key&nbsp;(start menu) and typing CMD then press the Return key.</li>
  <li>Type:</li>
</ul>
<p>cd Downloads cd o2019</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. If you just want Outlook, Word, Excel and Powerpoint:</p>
<p>setup.exe /configure</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Press RETURN at the end of the line. This should begin installation&nbsp;</p>
<p>immediately, with no need to wait to download anything else.</p>
<p>2. If you want Access as well as Outlook, Word, Excel and Powerpoint:</p>
<p>setup.exe /download configuration-access.xml setup.exe /configure configuration-access.xml</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Press RETURN at the end of each line. There will be a long wait&nbsp;</p>
<p>after the /download command, while it downloads Access. Nothing&nbsp;<br>will appear on the screen during this download. You can use Task&nbsp;<br>Manager to monitor network and storage activity.</p>
<p>3. If you want all the Office applications:</p>
<p>setup.exe /download configuration-all.xml setup.exe /configure configuration-all.xml</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When asked "Do you want to allow this application to make changes&nbsp;<br>to your device?" click YES.</p>
<p>This should then install Office 2019 for you.</p>
<p>If it complains that it cannot install 64-bit applications because&nbsp;<br>you have 32-bit applications installed, please uninstall your&nbsp;<br>32-bit Office applications manually, then rebooting. If this fails,&nbsp;<br>you can use the included SetupProd_OffScrub.exe program to&nbsp;<br>completely uninstall all Office applications, but be warned that&nbsp;<br>this may take an hour or more, and the program does NOT display any&nbsp;<br>progress (or indeed anything at all) for tens of minutes at a time&nbsp;<br>(you can view activity in Task Manager). We recommend trying to&nbsp;<br>manually uninstall 32-bit Office applications, and rebooting,&nbsp;<br>before using the SetupProd_OffScrub.exe tool as a last resort.</p>
<p>Once installed, Office will activate automatically with Blueberry's&nbsp;<br>Pro Plus 2019 Volume licence.</p>
