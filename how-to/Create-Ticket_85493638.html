                    <p>This feature lets you quickly create a ticket on the PTS using its ability to read special code in emails to log a ticket.</p><p><br/><strong style="line-height: 1.42857;">Why an add-in to create a ticket ?</strong></p><p>As you may know, we can already create tickets either using the website or sending an email to a dedicated email-address with some tags in it.<br/>The PTS has become a bit slower recently as there are always more data on it. For the support team, logging any new incoming ticket has not only become longer but unpleasant.</p><p>We have always been aware of this possibility to create tickets sending that kind of email : </p><p>&quot;<br/>To:  <a class="external-link" href="mailto:ticket-blu-ptssupport@pts.bbconsult.co.uk" rel="nofollow">ticket-blu-ptssupport@pts.bbconsult.co.uk<br/></a>-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>##auto-create-issue<br/>##subject PTS Slowing Down<br/>##report-by <a class="external-link" href="mailto:support@blueberrysystems.co.uk" rel="nofollow">support@blueberrysystems.co.uk</a><br/>##Status Open<br/>##priority High</p><p>The PTS is becoming bigger and bigger. Not its fault, but how to work more efficiently now ?<br/>&quot;</p><p>But as you can see, logging a simple sentence needs 5 more lines including a specific email address based on the item you want to create, the customer code and the project name ...<br/>Not to mention that if you want to log a ticket with a picture you first have to create the ticket, update it then go in attachments and add it. If you want to create an issue linked with the ticket, you then have to click the corresponding button.<br/>Doing all this in three steps may also be unpleasant, moreover you will be waiting for the website to load between each step. Or you can do all at once with a &quot;simple&quot; email ! </p><p>Fortunately, that is where this add-in is incoming, it will help you generating this email for you with a simple interface and let you log any ticket within seconds.</p><p><strong style="line-height: 1.42857;"><br/>How to do ?</strong></p><p>This feature is loaded as a button in the ribbon tab <em>Blueberry</em> in group <em>PTS Helper</em>.</p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" src="attachments/85493638/85493645.png" data-image-src="attachments/85493638/85493645.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="85493645" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="2016-05-31_12h00_15.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="85493638" data-linked-resource-container-version="1"></span><br/><em>PTS Helper group and Create Ticket button.</em></p><p>You understand that creating a ticket is based on any customer email.

Mainly there in case we may select statuses like <em>WfDt</em> in the future.</li><li>Priority : Represents the priority of your ticket. You can choose between later, low, normal, high and urgent priority.</li></ul><p><br/><strong>A few things you want to know</strong></p><p>The add-in auto-completes the subject field with the subject of the email. Feel free to edit it at your convenience.</p><p>The project list is updated at Outlook's startup using a webservice on the PTS (Thanks Oliver !). To avoid to load the PTS unecessarily, it is not re-updated each time the window is loaded but you may want to refresh the list.<br/>To do so, simply click the button on the right of the list. It will use the webservice to update the list.<br/>This list only contains projects of which status is &quot;In Support&quot; on PTS. Why would logging a ticket for a project that is not ?</p><p>The bottom part is loaded with auto-create issue ticked, open status and normal priority by default when opening the window.<br/>The top part has the subject copied from the email's one.</p><p>A piece of code tries to match a pattern between any email address in the <em>To</em> and <em>CC</em> fields (for example: &quot;bims-support@bbconsult.co.uk; Anne-Marie amf &lt;anne-marie.fallon-cotton@bbconsult.co.uk&gt;; Michelle Finn &lt;michelle.finn@bbconsult.co.uk&gt;; Jon Baker &lt;jon.baker@bbconsult.co.uk&gt;; Jason Cozza &lt;jason.cozza@blueberrysystems.co.uk&gt;&quot;) and the project list.<br/>Therefore, the correct project may already be selected. On this screen, the code has matched &quot;<a class="external-link" href="mailto:support@blueberrysystems.co.uk" rel="nofollow"><strong>bims</strong>-support@blueberrysystems.co.uk</a>&quot; with project &quot;<strong>BIMS </strong>Support&quot;.</p><p>You understand that the most project that there will be in the list, the less chances you will have to get a good match as the code is pretty simple.</p><p><br/><strong>One step further</strong></p><p>After fulfilling all these information, you can click <em>OK</em> and a new email window will pop with generated text in it :</p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" height="250" src="attachments/85493638/85493640.png" data-image-src="attachments/85493638/85493640.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="85493640" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="2016-05-31_12h36_09.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="85493638" data-linked-resource-container-version="1"></span><br/><em>New email window containing generated text after clicking &quot;OK&quot;.</em></p><p>You can then notice a few things :</p><ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>The email is in plain text. It is normal as we just want text as the description of the ticket, no need for more.</li><li>The diverse documents that were in it are auto-attached here. Feel free to add/delete any of it.</li><li>The generated text is added above a forward-like email. You may want to erase all the details like <em>From</em>, <em>To</em>, <em>CC</em> fields [...]</li></ul><p>At this point, you may want to modify the subject of the ticket. If you do so, try to match the subject of the mail and the subject of the tag ##subject for coherence (You will also understand why in the following).</p><p>The code that is attaching elements to the email is saving every single enclosed element within a folder and attaching them to this new email. Therefore, if you receive an email with a picture made as layers, you may experience issues. Also, if anyone in the conversation is using pictures for their signature, it may be enclosed as well. Do not forget to check the attached files before sending this email as it will then be part of PTS ticket's attachments.</p><p><br/>All done ! Now just click <em>Send</em> and everything will be computer work, whatever the time it takes to be created, whatever the attachments, if you want to create an issue or not [...] everything will be done and you will not have to wait for anything.</p><p><br/><strong>Auto-Answer to Customer</strong></p><p>As if it was not already enough, there is one left thing that this feature will be doing for you. It will track the answer email from PTS that should look like this one :</p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" height="250" src="attachments/85493638/85493639.png" data-image-src="attachments/85493638/85493639.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="85493639" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="2016-05-31_12h55_26.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.bbconsult.co.uk" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="85493638" data-linked-resource-container-version="1"></span><br/><em>Answer email from the PTS once the ticket has been created.</em></p><p>You may have noticed that this email contains a very valuable information that we want to get : The <strong>ticket number</strong>.<br/>You may also notice that this email has been sent by <a class="external-link" href="mailto:noreply@pts.bbconsult.co.uk" rel="nofollow">noreply@pts.bbconsult.co.uk</a> and that its subject is &quot;RE: &lt;ticket_subject&gt;&quot;.</p><p>This is exactly what the add-in will be waiting for, this precious email from the PTS that informs you of your ticket number. It will be looking for an email sent by PTS email address with your former email subject.<br/>That is why it is important that your email subject and tag ##subject are the same, to avoid any misunderstanding and to make things easier for you.</p><p>Once this email has been detected and the information extracted, a new email window should pop on your screen which is a <em>Reply to All</em> with an easy answer containing the ticket number.</p><p>&lt;A screenshot will be inserted as soon as possible&gt;<br/><em>Reply email window with ticket number and generated text.</em></p><p>Again, feel free to modify it at your convenience before sending it to the customer.</p>
