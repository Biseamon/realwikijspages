# English Language Aid
Blueberry offers financial support of £30 a month to remote members of staff who want to improve their English language skills for better productivity and effective communication.

This support is only available to members of staff who have successfully completed their trial or probation period and meet eligibility criteria. There is no automatic entitlement to this aid, and it remains at company’s discretion.

## Eligibility criteria:

Successful completion of trial/probation period;
Permanent worker status (this aid is not available to short-term contractors or freelancers);
Initial English language competence level is not above upper intermediate (to qualify for financial aid with English lessons you will need to be between elementary and upper intermediate level of competence).

## Application process:

All requests must be submitted to HR prior to the start of the course with at least 2 weeks’ notice, providing the following details:

Provisional start date of the course (if you have already started the course then the actual start date);
Provisional duration of the course;
Course provider/Tutor contact details;
Will the course lead to obtaining a certificate in the end? If so, what type of certificate?
The cost of course or tutor’s hourly charge;
Will you be able to provide a receipt?
Estimated initial level (if this has been done by your course provide/tutor).
 

Please note we may ask you to complete an English language level test to establish your initial level prior to your course start to confirm your eligibility.



Depending on your initial English language level, we will be able to support your studies using the following guidelines:

 

Elementary and pre-intermediate level - up to 2 years maximum;
Intermediate level - up to 1 year;
Upper intermediate – up to 6 months;
Anyone above upper intermediate – will not be eligible for financial support in connection with improving English skills.
 
## Claim process:

Once eligibility for financial aid has been confirmed by HR you can claim £30 a month by adding this amount to your monthly invoice as a manual adjustment. We will contact your course provider/tutor for the detailed feedback on the progress of your study every 6 months and review your eligibility for further financial support.


# Equipment Allowance
Blueberry offers a one-off fixed £380 allowance per year for you to buy a PC and/or to upgrade your computer/internet connectivity, to ensure that you have an efficient computing environment for your Blueberry work.

Blueberry can only offer this allowance to people who have successfully completed their trial period. It is not an entitlement. What can be claimed for rests ultimately with the MD, he may ask for proof of purchase or say that only part of an item qualifies for the allowance. His decision is final.

You get one allowance per year and when you buy hardware, it is yours, not BlueBerry’s – we’re not going to collect it from you later.

> Part time workers will only qualify for a percentage of the allowance, this percentage will be calculated by the MD and Accounts
> {.is-info}

To request this allowance, you should do the following:
1. In PTS, go to My Details → **My Equipment Requests**
1. Click **Request Equipment Allowance**
1. Enter the following details:
1. What equipment you would like to purchase
1. The cost of the equipment (in GBP)
1. A good explanation of why you need the new equipment
1. Click **Save** to add the request to your list of requests
1. Click Send **Requests** to send all new requests for approval by HR and your manager


> It's assumed that that each item of equiment is requested separately. For example, if developer >wants to request money for a new HDD and keyboard, the developer should create two requests.
>
>If multiple requests are created, they will all be sent for approval at the same time by clicking >on the 'Send Requests' button under the grid.
> {.is-info}

Your list of requests looks like this:

![help_equipment_dev.png](/help_equipment_dev.png)
Any requests that have no yet been approved by clicking on the edit icon

If the requested amount for new equipment exceeds the defined limit, the item will be written in red, like below:

![help_equipment_over.png](/help_equipment_over.png)

And in cases where new equipment is requested within 1 year of the previous request, the item will be highlighted in pink in grid, like below:

![help_equipment_early.png](/help_equipment_early.png)

> Just remember - the goal is to improve productivity, NOT to make best gaming PC.

# Holidays

## 1. Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to ensure that annual leave is managed fairly and consistently throughout Blueberry (UK and non-UK), and to inform all members of staff of the procedure that must be followed when requesting annual leave.

## 2. Scope
This policy applies to all UK staff working under a contract of employment on a permanent or fixed-term appointment with Blueberry and remote staff working under Blueberry Remote staff Terms and Conditions. The policy does not apply to ‘trialists’, freelance workers and independent contractors.

## 3. Entitlement
Entitlement to annual leave is stated in the schedule of the contract of employment for the UK-based staff and in Terms and Conditions for remote workers.

Blueberry’s annual leave year runs from January to December inclusive. All annual leave for the year should be taken within this period (except as described in section 7).  Any payment in lieu of any unused annual leave, where permitted by local laws, is at the company’s discretion. Please contact Human Resources (hereinafter HR) for advice.

## 4. Accrual System: how does it work?
For all full-time staff, annual leave is calculated based on the staff members' annual leave allowance and set contractual hours. This will be recorded in “My Holidays Statements” in PTS as an accrued amount at the end of each month.

If you join Blueberry part-way through the annual leave year, your entitlement to annual leave will be proportionate to the amount of time left in the annual leave year.

Part-time and variable hours workers accrue annual leave at a % of their annual holiday allowance pro-rata the hours worked. Annual leave accrues on a daily basis and may show variable amount of earned anneal leave at the end of each month.  It is important to note that annual leave accrual is limited to 40 hours a week. (For example, a developer has worked 45 hours a week for 4 weeks due to the project needs, s/he will get paid for an additional 20 hours at his/her standard hourly rate, but the annual leave will be earned on 40 hours a week only, extra hours will not accrue any holidays or any other company benefits).

## Nota bene!

**Local state holidays and annual leave allowance are merged into one personal annual leave allowance** that will constitute the baseline for accrual calculations.  (For example, in the UK there are 8 public holidays that would be added to a personal annual leave allowance of 20 days a year, totaling to 28 days of paid holidays per annum and this will constitute a worker’s personal holidays allowance, the same rule will apply to all other locations).

**Note: In countries where the amount of state holidays exceeds 15 days a year, Blueberry will only pay for the maximum of 15 days and the excess days must be taken out of annual leave allowance.**

State holidays are pre-booked in everyone’s holiday calendar (PTS time-sheet) in accordance with their location. This is also shown in “My Holidays Statements” in PTS as “state holiday taken” and this decreases the accrued amount of annual leave for that month as it is deducted from the total annual leave allowance. 

You can delete a pre-booked state holiday in your calendar (this can be done on “My Holidays” page in PTS) and re-allocate it to another date to use later in the year. The deleted state holiday is automatically added to annual leave allowance to be used later in the year. This will also be reflected in “My Holidays Statements” as an increased amount of annual leave to be used until the end of the leave year. This system allows greater flexibility to all Blueberry staff, domestic and remote. (See exception below).

**Exception**: Sri-Lanka (for remote workers based in Sri-Lanka the state holidays are not pre-booked, remote workers need to book the days they want to take off following the standard holidays booking procedure described in paragraph 6).

So called “short days” preceding a state holiday in the countries where this rule applies is no longer honoured by Blueberry.

## 5. Taking leave in advance of accrual
Leave accrues monthly in advance, at the rate of one twelfth of your annual leave entitlement. It is for your Manager, with the support of HR, to decide whether to authorise a request for leave in advance of accrual. A request of this nature should not exceed 10 working days (either in the current year or in the following leave year). If the leave is taken in advance of accrual, the net annual leave balance can go negative until more leave has been earned. 

If you leave Blueberry with a negative balance, a deduction will be made from your final salary to compensate for overused annual leave as per paragraph 10.

The status of annual leave balance can be checked in PTS, on “My Holidays Statements” page.

**Note for remote workers based in Russia**: January public holidays are pre-booked in your time-sheet as per paragraph 4. However, if you have not carried forward any holidays from the previous year (explained in paragraph 7), your annual leave balance will be negative until you accrue more annual leave later in the year. If, however, you decide to leave Blueberry before you accrue enough annual leave to compensate for the long holiday period in January, you are likely to experience a deduction from your final invoice (see paragraph 10). 

*We note that someone starting work at Blueberry later in the year will effectively receive additional holiday compared to normal state holidays. In other words, our system may benefit some but not others.  We have selected this system because it is legally required in the UK, and we have workers in many countries – so we want to make sure we have a fair and consistent system across the entire company.

Every case will be considered on its own merits. For any questions please contact HR. 

## 6. Leave Request Procedure
Notice is required for booking annual leave. The minimum notice for annual leave up to 5 working days is 2 weeks; annual leave over 5 working days requires one month’s notice. Emergency or ad-hoc situations can be considered on the basis of individual circumstances.

Holiday requests submitted at short notice will be reviewed and considered based on individual circumstances by your Manager, but the Manager reserves the right to reject a request on the grounds of short notice.

Annual Leave must be requested in PTS.  A request is to be sent to your Manager via PTS, on “My Holidays” page and, when approved, it will automatically appear in your time-sheet and will be shown as “booked” on your “My Holidays” page.

**This process applies to both paid and unpaid leave requests. However, unpaid leave also requires HR approval and is at the company’s discretion.**

Your Manager will consider your request having regard to the needs of the business. HR may be consulted before a final decision is made.

You may only commit to your leave plans on receipt of approval from your Manager which authorises your request for leave. If your request for leave is refused, your Manager will notify you as soon as possible and a new request can be submitted.

If you wish to dispute your Manager’s decision to decline your annual leave request, you may use Blueberry’s grievance procedure. Please contact HR for advice.

If your plans have changed, you can cancel the approved leave on “My Holidays” page in PTS or in your time-sheet without your Manager’s approval. The PTS will send a notification to your Manager, but it is advisable to let your Manager know about the changed plans and discuss an alternative leave request that will need to be submitted following the usual process.

Where there are conflicting annual leave requirements, priority will be given to the member of staff whose request was received first, subject to business needs.

Should you take unauthorised annual leave you may be subject to disciplinary action, including dismissal.

## 7. Carrying forward annual leave
All Blueberry workers are allowed to carry forward up to 5 days of annual leave to the following year.  If you have more than 5 days left at the end of December, a payment in lieu of the excess days (above the unused 5) may be considered in exceptional circumstances, **where permitted by local laws**, and 5 days can be carried forward. All payments are at the company’s discretion and will be considered on a case by case basis. Please contact HR for advice. 

Carried forward annual leave must be used by the end of the following February after the end of the annual leave year to which the unused holiday relates, or it will be automatically forfeited.  Payment in lieu of holidays may be considered in exceptional circumstances, **where permitted by local laws**, but it is at the company’s discretion and will be considered on a case by case basis. Please contact HR for advice. 

Should Blueberry decide to make payment in lieu of unused annual leave, payment will be made at the salary rate in force at the date the leave was accrued.

A negative annual leave balance can be carried forward to the following annual leave year (up to 10 working days).

To reduce the risk of losing carried over annual leave, all the January and February state holidays will be automatically substituted with the days carried over from the previous year and the state holidays will be automatically added to the annual leave allowance for the current year so that they can be used later in the year.

## 8. Sickness during Annual Leave
Annual leave may only be reclaimed by staff where their sickness is confirmed by receipt of a GP or hospital medical certificate.

If you are ill during a period of annual leave you may be able to reclaim the time as sick leave if you:

- notify your Manager and HR on the first day of sickness (by following company process on reporting sickness) and
- provide a medical certificate (regardless of the length of absence).
 
## 9. Late Return from Annual Leave
If for any reason, you know that you will be late returning from annual leave you must notify your Manager and HR of the late return as soon as possible and discuss and agree revised arrangements i.e. additional annual leave, unpaid leave or other arrangements. Failure to do so will render you liable to disciplinary action for unauthorised absence.

## 10. Leaving Blueberry
If you are serving your notice period, you will only be guaranteed annual leave during that time if either:

- the annual leave was booked prior to the start of the notice period; or
- the notice period runs between two annual leave calendar years and you have not taken your minimum statutory entitlement for the current year.

Annual leave requests submitted during the notice period will be approved where possible, but it may not be practicable to approve such requests because of the need for you to complete outstanding work or hand over to a successor. Blueberry, therefore, reserves the right to refuse requests for leave made during the notice period (subject to the requirement to comply with the Working Time Regulations 1998), and to make payment in lieu of annual leave.

Unused annual leave, which has accrued but has not been taken, will be paid with your final salary; such payment will be subject to deductions for tax and national insurance contributions (for UK employees only). Where annual leave taken exceeds the numbers of days accrued at the date of termination, Blueberry will deduct the appropriate, corresponding sum from your final salary (applies to all staff across the company).

## Payment

**Payment Systems**
When working for Blueberry your pay will be calculated one of two ways - These are called "Scheme" and "Flat".

Flat payment is simple - you get £X per hour but no holiday or other money (you can take holiday, but you will not be paid for those days).  This payment system is normally used for employees who are on an initial Trial or do a very small amount of part time work for us.

“Scheme” payment comes with certain benefits:

Paid state holidays (Calculated based on your location) - Paid Holiday (currently 15 days per year)
Equipment allowance - £380 per year
Sickness and maternity pay
Internet monthly allowance – up to £30 per month
If you have a basic pay of £x per hour, these additions are approximately the same as 20%-30% more on your basic pay.

Note:  equipment allowance is NOT salary.  To qualify for equipment allowance, you must tell us what equipment you need and send details of prices.  However, once you purchase the equipment, it is yours to keep.

As it suggests, we expect a certain amount of loyalty and a level of professionalism from people who are paid using the "Scheme" system. If you are deemed to be under performing, or abusing the system, we reserve the right to return you to the Flat payment system.

**Arranging Payment**
Blueberry pays remote employees based on a monthly timesheet submitted via our PTS. This timesheet is used to generate an invoice for the developer which is then entered into our accounts.

This timesheet and invoice submission system is part of the PTS Client application. Information on how use this to create timesheets and submit your invoices can be found here.

Blueberry pays invoices during the first week of the month so any invoice received before the end of the previous month will be included in this payment run.

**The Transfer**
Blueberry’s preferred transfer method is via a system called Moneybookers or Skrill.

Using this service allows us to transfer in Pounds Sterling, the same currency that we calculate your invoice in, while also allowing you to receive the transfer in your own base currency. Also, because the transfer fee for Moneybookers is low, Blueberry pays this fee on your behalf. These funds can then be transferred directly to your bank account from your Moneybookers account.

We ask that all new remote employees set up a Moneybookers account, you can do this here: https://www.moneybookers.com/app/

We also offer a Payoneer service, you will have to arrange a GBP Card to be sent to you, it wont work with a USD account you already hold. If you are interested please contact Accounts.

We can also arrange direct bank transfers, but this is an expensive to do internationally and Blueberry will not pay for any charges that are incurred. This can only be arranged with prior discussion and agreement with Accounts.


## Sick Leave
Remote Employees may take up to 5 days paid sick leave per year if you are unable to work due to illness or incapacity.

If you are unable to work you should notify your Manager, Liubov Green and Accounts as soon as you can. You will be required to produce evidence from a qualified doctor that you are unable to work, which you should send to Liubov Green.

An acceptable document for identity confirmation is an internal passport or an international passport that contains your address. Please send a legible scan or photograph of your passport to the HR Department at hr@bbconsult.co.uk

If your passport does not show your current address then please contact the HR Department to discuss alternative identity documents.

## Trial Project Process
**Introduction**
Blueberry is a UK based software development company. There are three companies in our group:

Blueberry Consultants - http://bbconsult.co.uk
Blueberry Systems - http://blueberrysystems.co.uk/
Blueberry Software – http://bbsoftware.co.uk
Blueberry Consultants and Blueberry Systems both undertake contract development for many UK companies, departments connected to government, and many entrepreneurs. Blueberry has been in business for 18 years, and has completed over 200 projects.

Blueberry Software develops and sells the FlashBack range of screen recorder products. We have been doing this for over 10 years.

Blueberry is unusual in a number of ways: 

Everyone here is technical – the CEO, Martin Green, was a developer from the age of 14, and he remains hands-on with technology. The managers are all ex-developers.
We have a wide team of people – 37 in the UK and over 75 are spread across the world with the majority located in Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan.
Everyone works directly for the UK company – we do not have any representative bodies or agencies outside the UK.  Instead, developers work from home or sometimes a small local office. 
We are very flexible about working patterns, and we always pay on time.
We have a simple company structure – all the companies are 100% owned by the CEO – there are no other shareholders to demand we do things differently. This means that if we need to do something differently, or there is an urgent problem, it can be solved very rapidly.
Blueberry's mission is simple: we exist to develop good software, and (ideally) to improve the world by doing so. Although most of our business is custom software, we are also developing a few new products which we hope will take us closer to this goal.

Blueberry is financially stable – we have good customers, and reserves. However, we are not (yet) Google – we must work to earn money to pay salaries, of course – and we do not have much spare money.

**Trial Process**

Blueberry has been working with remote developers for many years and welcomes developers who are interested in a long-term full-time remote employment. However, we can only offer one a permanent position at Blueberry after a successful trial. During this period we assign a trial project for 3-4 weeks, to see if we can work together.

The goal of the trial project is not just to test technical skills – it is just as much about testing communication, because communication is critical in remote development. (See below for more on this).

Blueberry trials are paid. We generally pay people via the Skrill site, because it has very low transaction costs. Some people ask to be paid by direct bank transfer – this is OK, but please bear in mind that there are higher charges, which we ask developers to pay. Skrill is generally better and much cheaper.

We also ask developers to create a UK alias (English nicknames). This practice started many years ago when outsourcing to Russia was less common. One of the reasons why we started this practice is that Slavic names are generally quite difficult to spell and pronounce by the English speakers. Therefore, English nicknames make this a little easier for us and save us some time. We may stop this practice in the future, but at present we still require it – it would be unfair to existing developers if we stopped for new people.

The UK alias is just an English name, ideally an English version of your own name. So, for example, if your first name is Ivan we will call you John at Blueberry. The same applies to surnames. For example, the closest English phonetic equivalent for Natalchenko would be Nathan. Therefore, we call Ivan Natalchenko - one of our Russian developers - John Nathan.

There are resources on the web listing English names, or we can help you with this.

We also need your middle/patronymic name initial, because we use three-letter user names for internal systems. So, for instance, Ivan Petrovich Sidorov will become ips on our systems.
We currently use Subversion as our source control system. We require all code – even trial project code – to be checked into source control so that we definitely have a copy.

**Questions?**

In general, the trial process is usually run by Duncan Forsyth, Quality Assurance Manager or by one of the Project Managers. All the queries related to your trial should be directed to your trial manager as your first point of reference.

All general Human Resources and employment related queries should be directed to Liubov Green, HR Manager at: liubov.green@bbconsult.co.uk or at hr@bbconsult.co.uk

For PTS queries please contact Oliver Goodman (Oleg Grudinin), our Russian speaking Project Manager. He can be contacted by e-mail: oliver.goodman@bbconsult.co.uk

Offshore Working – General Notes
Blueberry has been working with remote developers for over 15 years. We have a very strong experience of what makes the process work well. In particular, communication skills are very important.

On a larger project, most developers will work with a UK based development manager. The manager collects requirements from customers and works with developers to deliver the project.

Each development manager has his own communication approach – some use email mostly, some prefer Skype. We do sometimes use Skype to make audio or video calls, but this is a little rare – most of our developers are much better at written rather than spoken English. But if you have good spoken English, we are happy to try it.

The following is our advice to developers who are new to working remotely:

**Regular communication**. We like to get frequent emails or other communications – we cannot see you, so we do not know what you are doing.
**Rapid Replies**. If we are discussing a problem, and each reply takes 4 hours, it will take days to resolve the problem. So ideally we like developers to reply quickly to mails.
**Tell us about problems**. Most developers assume that we will be angry if there is some problem – e.g. power cut or personal issue. This is wrong: we cannot help you resolve a problem if we do not know about it! We are reasonable people – if you need time off for a problem that is OK. But we need you to be reasonable too – if there is a power cut, try to find another place to work.
**Answer all questions**. If someone writes an email with three questions, answer them all in one e-mail. Many people fail this – they answer, say, two questions out of three, leaving the sender to ask the third question again.

These rules are not fixed – if you have a big piece of work to do, then it is often fine for you to be working on it without replying to email quickly. Just let us know. And we do not expect you to be online all the time.

But we have clear experience: the people, our managers most like to work with, are the best communicators.
