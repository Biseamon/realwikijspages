# Getting Started

The Blueberry Wiki is full of useful information about everything Blueberry related.

The Wiki is divided into multiple spaces but during a trial, you will only have access to this section, the section containing Information for Remote Working and the section for Blueberry Web Template of the main space. These sections contain details of everything you need to know about getting set up for the various systems and processes that you will need to be familiar with during your trial.

Please review each of these.
