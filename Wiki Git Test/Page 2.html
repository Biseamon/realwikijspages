We use the ASP.NET Core User Management feature to store strong hashes of passwords using the PBKDF2 algorithm. Passwords are never known to anyone except the user. Passwords are checked client side against the &quot;<a class="external-link" href="https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn" rel="nofollow">Low-Budget Password Strength Estimation</a>&quot;.
